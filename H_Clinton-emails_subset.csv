Re: Syria aiding Qaddafi
This memo has two parts. Part one is the report that Syria is providing air support for Qaddafi. Part two is a note
to Cody from Lord David Owen, former UK foreign secretary on his views of an increasingly complex crisis. It
seems that the situation is developing into a protracted civil war with various nations backing opposing sides
with unforeseen consequences. Under these circumstances the crucial challenge is to deprive Qaddafi of his
strategic depthâ€”his support both financial and military.
I. Report
During the afternoon of March 3, advisers to Muammar Qaddafi stated privately that the Libyan
Leader has decided that civil war is inevitable, pitting troops and mercenary troops loyal to him
against the rebel forces gathering around Benghazi. Qaddafi is convinced that these rebels are
being supported by the United States, Western Europe and Israel. On March 2 Qaddafi told his
son Saif al-Islam that he believes the intelligence services of the United States, Great Britain,
Egypt, and France have deployed paramilitary officers to Benghazi to assist in organizing,
training, and equipping opposition forces. Qaddafi is convinced that the National Libyan Council
(NLC), and its leader, former Minister of Justice Mustafa Mohamed Abdel Galil have been
chosen by the foreign powers to replace him. On March 1 advisors to Qaddafi stated that

Qaddafi's cousin, Col. Ali Qaddafiddam had failed in efforts to recruit fighters among the
Egyptian population living immediately across the border with Libya.
These individuals added that during the week of February 21 the Libyan Leader spoke to Syrian
President Bashir al-Assad on at least three occasions by secure telephone lines. During the
conversations Qaddafi asked that Syrian officers and technicians currently training the Libyan
Air Force be placed under command of the Libyan Army and allowed to fight against the rebel
forces.
(Source Comment: Senior Libyan Army officers still loyal to Qaddafi added that On February
23, President Assad told General Isam Hallaq, the commander in chief of the Syrian Air Force,
to instruct the pilots and technicians in Tripoli to help the Libyan regime, should full scale Civil
War breaks out in the immediate future.)
On March 2, a military officer with ties to Qaddfi's son Khamis stated privately that the number
of Libyan pilots defecting to the opposition has destroyed the morale and professional spirit of
the Libyan Air Force at this critical moment, when Tripoli's air superiority is its principal weapon
against insurgents. In the opinion of this individual Qaddafi and his senior military advisors are
convinced that the European Union and the U.S will impose a no-fly zone over Libya in the
immediate future. These advisors believe that the no fly zone will serve as air support for
opposition forces. They are also prepared for the Western allies to bomb anti-aircraft facilities in
and around Tripoli in preparation for the establishment of the no-fly zone. Foreign Minister
Mousa Kousa is convinced that that Russia and Turkey will oppose the move, and may prevent
the implementation of the no fly zone.
The Syrian soldiers in Libya are part of a mission established in 1984 following the signing of a
military agreement between Qaddafi and Syria's long-time ruler and Bashir's father, Hafez al-
Assad, in the presence of General Soubhi Haddad, who was the commander in chief of the Air
Force at the time. Both Air Forces are equipped with Russian materiel and have had long-
standing, close links with Moscow.

In exchange for Syria's help, Libya provided financial support to the Syrian state, including funds
in support of operations carried out by the Syrian intelligence services in Lebanon. Libyan money
helped Hafez al-Assad bribe his brother Rifaat, the author of an attempted coup d'etat in 1983,
to leave the country and go into exile in Spain and France, where he has remained ever since.
According to individuals with access to the Syrian military, Damascus has also sent a second
team of pilots and technicians to Tripoli. These are lower-ranking officers loyal to the regime
who are specialized in flying helicopters. Before their departure for Tripoli on February 23, they
met with General Allaq and General Jamil Hasan, head of Air Force's Intelligence.
(Source Comment: During the afternoon of 3 March, an associate of Saif al-Islam Qaddafi
stated that he and the Libyan leaders other family members were concerned over the
announcement of Jose Luis Moreno-Ocampo, chief prosecutor of the International Criminal
Court (ICC), announced that he was investigating Qaddafi, his sons Khamis, the commander of
the 32 battalion, and Montasem, as well as the head of Gadhafi's personal security detail, the
Director-General of the External Security Organization (Abuzaid Dorda), the spokesman of the
regime (Musa Ibrahim), and the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Mousa Kousa). This source added
that Saif al-Islam had said that Qaddafi himself found the announcement amusing.)
From: Lord Owen
Cody,
Realistically the UN will not authorise a no fly zone while Gaddafi continues to hold off bombing and
strafing but keeping it up front and on the military agenda keeps him worried. Yet for a few frustrating months
that ambivalence kept the Serbian aeroplanes on the ground before we acted. My hope is that preparations
continue with visuals of planes flying off carriers, airborne early warning planes flying and people with clout
outside the Administration demanding preparations. But and it is a big BUT what else can and should we be
doing? Encourage humanitarian ships and convoys from Egypt to bring in supplies since we must ensure the
cities in the East can hold up living standards, maybe for months. More adventurous, Egyptian Special Forces to
go in and advise, even supplying hand held missiles. It appears they have few missiles; the military in the East
having been deliberately kept ill-equipped. There is old Nasserite sentiment for a Federation of Egypt, Sudan
and Libya. I know some will say Egypt has enough problems and they should stay resolutely focused on
domestic reforms. it is delicate but words alone and the balance of advantage will slip to Gaddafi. A Gaddafi
victory is possible and needs to be weighed in the balance now when deciding what to do.
I'm more worried than I am ready to say publicly.
Yours
David

Re: Syria aiding Qaddafi
This memo has two parts. Part one is the report that Syria is providing air support for Qaddafi. Part two is a note
to Cody from Lord David Owen, former UK foreign secretary on his views of an increasingly complex crisis. It
seems that the situation is developing into a protracted civil war with various nations backing opposing sides
with unforeseen consequences. Under these circumstances the crucial challenge is to deprive Qaddafi of his
strategic depthâ€”his support both financial and military.
I. Report
During the afternoon of March 3, advisers to Muammar Qaddafi stated privately that the Libyan
Leader has decided that civil war is inevitable, pitting troops and mercenary troops loyal to him
against the rebel forces gathering around Benghazi. Qaddafi is convinced that these rebels are
being supported by the United States, Western Europe and Israel. On March 2 Qaddafi told his
son Saif al-Islam that he believes the intelligence services of the United States, Great Britain,

Egypt, and France have deployed paramilitary officers to Benghazi to assist in organizing,
_raining, and equipping opposition forces. Qaddafi is convinced that the National Libyan Council
:NLC), and its leader, former Minister of Justice Mustafa Mohamed Abdel Gall have been
:thosen by the foreign powers to replace him. On March 1 advisors to Qaddafi stated that
Q,addafi's cousin, Col. Al Qaddafiddam had failed in efforts to recruit fighters among the
Egyptian population living immediately across the border with Libya.
These individuals added that during the week of February 21 the Libyan Leader spoke to Syrian
president Bashir al-Assad on at least three occasions by secure telephone lines. During the
:,onversations Qaddafi asked that Syrian officers and technicians currently training the Libyan
/kir Force be placed under command of the Libyan Army and allowed to fight against the rebel
tbrces.
(Source Comment: Senior Libyan Army officers still loyal to Qaddafi added that On February
23, President Assad told General Isam HaIlaq, the commander in chief of the Syrian Air Force,
:o instruct the pilots and technicians in Tripoli to help the Libyan regime, should full scale Civil
War breaks out in the immediate future.)
On March 2, a military officer with ties to Qaddfi's son Khamis stated privately that the number
Df Libyan pilots defecting to the opposition has destroyed the morale and professional spirit of
,he Libyan Air Force at this critical moment, when Tripoli's air superiority is its principal weapon
against insurgents. In the opinion of this individual Qaddafi and his senior military advisors are
convinced that the European Union and the U.S will impose a no-fly zone over Libya in the
immediate future. These advisors believe that the no fly zone will serve as air support for
Dpposition forces. They are also prepared for the Western allies to bomb anti-aircraft facilities in
and around Tripoli in preparation for the establishment of the no-fly zone. Foreign Minister
Mousa Kousa is convinced that that Russia and Turkey will oppose the move, and may prevent
the implementation of the no fly zone.
The Syrian soldiers in Libya are part of a mission established in 1984 following the signing of a
military agreement between Qaddafi and Syria's long-time ruler and Bashir's father, Hafez al-

From: Lord Owen
Cody,
Realistically the UN will not authorise a no fly zone while Gaddafi continues to hold off bombing and
strafing but keeping it up front and on the military agenda keeps him worried. Yet for a few frustrating months
that ambivalence kept the Serbian aeroplanes on the ground before we acted. My hope is that preparations
continue with visuals of planes flying off carriers, airborne early warning planes flying and people with clout
outside the Administration demanding preparations. But and it is a big BUT what else can and should we be
doing? Encourage humanitarian ships and convoys from Egypt to bring in supplies since we must ensure the
cities in the East can hold up living standards, maybe for months. More adventurous, Egyptian Special Forces to
go in and advise, even supplying hand held missiles. It appears they have few missiles; the military in the East
having been deliberately kept ill-equipped. There is old Nasserite sentiment for a Federation of Egypt, Sudan
and Libya. I know some will say Egypt has enough problems and they should stay resolutely focused on
domestic reforms. it is delicate but words alone and the balance of advantage will slip to Gaddafi. A Gaddafi

Anti-Muslim film director in hiding, following
Libya, Egypt violence
By Nia-Malika Henderson and Michelle Boorstein, Updated: Wednesday, September 12,
1:30 PM
The director of a controversial anti-Islam film has gone into hiding, according to reports, fearing reprisals over a
work that has sparked violence in Egypt and Libya and led to the deaths of four Americans.
Sam Bacile, a California real estate developer, posted a 13-minute clip of ""The Innocence of Muslims,"" in July,
and the film became a lighting rod after the Egyptian media began showing parts of it on air and dubbed
versions of the English-language film appeared on the Internet.
It depicts the Prophet Muhammad as a bumbling idiot, born out of wedlock and making up verses to the Islamic
holy book to suit his purposes and desires. The film also shows him as having intimate relations with women
and suggests that he was gay.
Any flesh-and-blood depiction of Muhammad is offensive to Muslims.
""This is a political movie,"" Bacile, 56, told the Associated Press, adding that he didn't expect the film to spark
such fury. ""The U.S. lost a lot of money and a lot of people in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but we're fighting
with ideas.""
Bacile identified himself to several news organizations as an Israeli-born Jew who works as a real estate
developer in California. Yet his identity remains something of a mysteryâ€”Bacile is not listed in any directories
or incorporations or real estate deeds and is not licensed in California as a real estate broker. And Israeli
authorities told the Associated Press that they don't have any records of Bacile.

There are also questions about whether the film sparked the violence in Libya, which according to some reports
seemed to be more coordinated than the protests in Egypt where some 2,000 gathered outside the U.S. Embassy
in Cairo.
The eruption of violence came around the llth anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks, as Americans paused
to remember the 3,000 people who lost their lives.
Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three others were killed after protesters attacked the U.S. consulate in
Benghazi.

(CAIR), condemned both the killings and the film. Awad said in a statement:
""We urge that this ignorant attempt to provoke the religious feelings of Muslims in the Arabic-speaking world
be ignored and that its extremist producers not be given the cheap publicity they so desperately seek.
""Those who created this trashy film do not represent the people of America or the Christian faith. The only
proper response to intentional provocations such as this film is to redouble efforts to promote mutual
understanding between faiths and to marginalize extremists of all stripes.""
A controversial Florida pastor was among those promoting ""The Innocence of Muslims,"" which cost $5 million
to make and stars amateur actors, some of whom appear to be wearing make-up to darken their faces.
Bacile said that the film was backed by 100 Jewish donors, according to Bacile.
Among the promoters is Morris Sadek, who heads the National American Cooptic Assembly and the Rev. Terry
Jones, leader of a small group that holds virulently anti-Islam events.
Tuesday evening, Jones sent out a press release blaming the Muslim faith for the protests and saying the group
would be running a trailer later in the evening for the film.
The trailer was part of a one-to-two hour ""live event"" that Jones was doing from his Gainesville center for Sept.
11, said Fran Ingram, a spokeswoman for his group, Stand Up America. The whole broadcast included the
handlebar-moustached pastor in a black ""infidel"" t-shirt standing in front of a fabric lynched devil dressed in a
white turban for what they group dubbed ""International Judge Muhammed Day.""
It wasn't clear if Jones, who garnered worldwide attention in recent years with his threats to burn the Koran,
had promoted ""The Innocence of Muslims"" before the rioting began.
Asked if Jones was connected in any way with the making of the film, Ingram said she couldn't comment.

The film also shows him as having intimate relations with womenand suggests that he was gay.Any flesh-and-blood depiction of Muhammad is offensive to Muslims.""This is a political movie,"" Bacile, 56, told the Associated Press, adding that he didn't expect the film to sparksuch fury. ""The U.S. lost a lot of money and a lot of people in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but we're fightingwith ideas.""Bacile identified himself to several news organizations as an Israeli-born Jew who works as a real estatedeveloper in California.

Re: Syria aiding Qaddafi
This memo has two parts. Part one is the report that Syria is providing air support for Qaddafi. Part two is a note
to Cody from Lord David Owen, former UK foreign secretary on his views of an increasingly complex crisis. It
seems that the situation is developing into a protracted civil war with various nations backing opposing sides
with unforeseen consequences. Under these circumstances the crucial challenge is to deprive Qaddafi of his
strategic depth--his support both financial and military.
I. Report
During the afternoon of March 3, advisers to Muammar Qaddafi stated privately that the Libyan
Leader has decided that civil war is inevitable, pitting troops and mercenary troops loyal to him
against the rebel forces gathering around Benghazi. Qaddafi is convinced that these rebels are
being supported by the United States, Western Europe and Israel. On March 2 Qaddafi told his
son Saif al-Islam that he believes the intelligence services of the United States, Great Britain,

Egypt, and France have deployed paramilitary officers to Benghazi to assist in organizing,
training, and equipping opposition forces. Qaddafi is convinced that the National Libyan Council
(NLC), and its leader, former Minister of Justice Mustafa Mohamed Abdel Galil have been
chosen by the foreign powers to replace him. On March 1 advisors to Qaddafi stated that
Qaddafi's cousin, Col. Ali Qaddafiddam had failed in efforts to recruit fighters among the
Egyptian population living immediately across the border with Libya.
These individuals added that during the week of February 21 the Libyan Leader spoke to Syrian
President Bashir al-Assad on at least three occasions by secure telephone lines. During the
conversations Qaddafi asked that Syrian officers and technicians currently training the Libyan
Air Force be placed under command of the Libyan Army and allowed to fight against the rebel
forces.
(Source Comment: Senior Libyan Army officers still loyal to Qaddafi added that On February
23, President Assad told General Isam HaIlaq, the commander in chief of the Syrian Air Force,
to instruct the pilots and technicians in Tripoli to help the Libyan regime, should full scale Civil
War breaks out in the immediate future.)
On March 2, a military officer with ties to Qaddfi's son Khamis stated privately that the number
of Libyan pilots defecting to the opposition has destroyed the morale and professional spirit of
the Libyan Air Force at this critical moment, when Tripoli's air superiority is its principal weapon
against insurgents. In the opinion of this individual Qaddafi and his senior military advisors are
convinced that the European Union and the U.S will impose a no-fly zone over Libya in the
immediate future. These advisors believe that the no fly zone will serve as air support for
opposition forces. They are also prepared for the Western allies to bomb anti-aircraft facilities in
and around Tripoli in preparation for the establishment of the no-fly zone. Foreign Minister
Mousa Kousa is convinced that that Russia and Turkey will oppose the move, and may prevent
the implementation of the no fly zone.
The Syrian soldiers in Libya are part of a mission established in 1984 following the signing of a
military agreement between Qaddafi and Syria's long-time ruler and Bashir's father, Hafez al-

Assad, in the presence of General Soubhi Haddad, who was the commander in chief of the Air
Force at the time. Both Air Forces are equipped with Russian materiel and have had long-
standing, close links with Moscow.
In exchange for Syria's help, Libya provided financial support to the Syrian state, including funds
in support of operations carried out by the Syrian intelligence services in Lebanon. Libyan money
helped Hafez al-Assad bribe his brother Rifaat, the author of an attempted coup d'etat in 1983,
to leave the country and go into exile in Spain and France, where he has remained ever since.
According to individuals with access to the Syrian military, Damascus has also sent a second
team of pilots and technicians to Tripoli. These are lower-ranking officers loyal to the regime
who are specialized in flying helicopters. Before their departure for Tripoli on February 23, they
met with General Allaq and General Jamil Hasan, head of Air Force's Intelligence.
(Source Comment: During the afternoon of 3 March, an associate of Saif al-Islam Qaddafi
stated that he and the Libyan leaders other family members were concerned over the
announcement of Jose Luis Moreno-Ocampo, chief prosecutor of the International Criminal
Court (ICC), announced that he was investigating Qaddafi, his sons Khamis, the commander of
the 32 battalion, and Montasem, as well as the head ofGadhaffs personal security detail, the
Director-General of the External Security Organization (Abuzaid Dorda), the spokesman of the
regime (Musa Ibrahim), and the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Mousa Kousa). This source added
that Saif al-Islam had said that Qaddafi himself found the announcement amusing.)
From: Lord Owen
Cody,
Realistically the UN will not authorise a no fly zone while Gaddafi continues to hold off bombing and
strafing but keeping it up front and on the military agenda keeps him worried. Yet for a few frustrating months
that ambivalence kept the Serbian aeroplanes on the ground before we acted. My hope is that preparations
continue with visuals of planes flying off carriers, airborne early warning planes flying and people with clout
outside the Administration demanding preparations. But and it is a big BUT what else can and should we be
doing? Encourage humanitarian ships and convoys from Egypt to bring in supplies since we must ensure the
cities in the East can hold up living standards, maybe for months. More adventurous, Egyptian Special Forces to
go in and advise, even supplying hand held missiles. It appears they have few missiles; the military in the East
having been deliberately kept ill-equipped. There is old Nasserite sentiment for a Federation of Egypt, Sudan
and Libya. I know some will say Egypt has enough problems and they should stay resolutely focused on
domestic reforms. it is delicate but words alone and the balance of advantage will slip to Gaddafi. A Gaddafi

September 12, 2012
Yesterday, our U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya was attacked. Heavily armed militants assaulted the compound
and set fire to our buildings, American and Libyan security personnel battled the attackers together, Four Americans
were killed, They included Sean Smith, a Foreign Service information management officer, and our Ambassador to Libya
Chris Stevens. We are still making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals.
This is an attack that should shock the conscience of people of all faiths around the vvorld. We condemn in the strongest
terms this senseless act of violence, and we send our prayers to the families, friends, and colleagues of those we've lost.
All over the world, every day, America's diplomats and development experts risk their lives in the service of our country
and our values, because they believe that the United States must be a force for peace and progress in the world, that

ship in the port of Benghazi and began building our relationships with Libya's revolutionaries. He risked his life to stop a
tyrant, then gave his life trying to help build a better Libya. The world needs more Chris Stevenses. I spoke with his
sister, Ann, this morning, and told her that he will be remembered as a hero by many nations.
Sean Smith was an Air Force veteran. He spent 10 years as an information management officer in the State Department,
he was posted at The Hague, and was in Libya on a brief temporary assignment. He was a husband to his wife Heather,
with whom I spoke this morning. He was a father to two young children, Samantha and Nathan. They will grow up being
proud of the service their father gave to our country, service that took him from Pretoria to Baghdad, and finally to
Benghazi.
The mission that drew Chris and Sean and their colleagues to Libya is both noble and necessary, and we arid the people
of Libya honor their memory by carrying it forward. This is not easy. Today, many Americans are asking indeed, I asked
myself â€” how could this happen? How could this happen in a country we helped liberate, in a city we helped save from
destruction? This question reflects just how complicated and, at times, how confounding the world can be
But we must be clear-eyed, even in our grief. This was an attack by a small and savage group â€” not the people or
Government of Libya. Everywhere Chris and his team went in Libya, in a country scarred by war and tyranny, they were
hailed as friends and partners. And when the attack came yesterday, Libyans stood and fought to defend our post, Some
were wounded. Libyans carried Chris' body to the hospital, and they helped rescue and lead other Americans to safety.
And last night, when I spoke with the President of Libya, he strongly condemned the violence and pledged every effort
to protect our people and pursue those responsible.
The friendship between our countries, borne out of shared struggle, will not be another casualty of this attack. A free
and stable Libya is still in America's interest and security, and we will not turn our back on that nor will we rest until
those responsible for these attacks are found and brought to justice. We are working closely with the Libyan authorities
to move swiftly and surely. We are also working with partners around the world to safeguard other American embassies,
consulates, and citizens.
There will be more time later to reflect, but today, we have work to do. There is no higher priority than protecting our
men and women wherever they serve. We are working to determine the precise motivations and methods of those who
carried out this assault. Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior, along with the protest that took place at our
Embassy in Cairo yesterday, as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet. America's commitment to
religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear â€”there is no justification for this,
none. Violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith. And as long as there are those who would take innocent life
in the name of God, the world will never know a true and lasting peace.

It is especially difficult that this happened on September 11th. It's an anniversary that means a great deal to all
Americans. Every year on that day, we are reminded that our work is not yet finished, that the job of putting an end to
violent extremism and building a safe and stable world continues. But September 11th means even more than that. It is a
day on which we remember thousands of American heroes, the bonds that connect all Americans, wherever we are on
this Earth, and the values that see us through every storm. And now it is a day on which we will remember Sean, Chris,
and their colleagues.
May God bless them, and may God bless the thousands of Americans working in every corner of the world who make
this country the greatest force for peace, prosperity, and progress, and a force that has always stood for human dignity â€”
the greatest force the world has ever known. And may God continue to bless the United States of America.
Thank you.

SUBJECT: Libya (37)
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional
Council, as well as the highest levels of European Governments, and Western
Intelligence and security services.
THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION COMES FROM AN EXTREMELY
SENSITIVE SOURCE AND SHOULD BE HANDLED WITH CARE.
1. On September 12, 2012 Libyan President Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf
told senior advisors that the death of the U.S. Ambassador at the hands of Islamist
militia forces represents a threat to the future of the newly elected General National
Congress (GNC) Government. According to a sensitive source, el Magariaf
believes that the primary goal of this and other attacks on Western facilities is to
demonstrate that the GNC cannot protect its non-Islamic friends. Libyan security
officials believe that the attack was carried out by forces of the Islamist militia
group calling itself the Ansar al Sharia brigade; working out of camps in the
Eastern suburbs of Benghazi. These officials added that their sources indicate that
this group is led by former members of the old Libyan Islamic Fighting Group
(LIFG), some of whom are loyal to Islamist General Abdelhakim Belhaj. The
same officials were quick to point out that they have no evidence that Belhaj had
any direct involvement in this attack. They also have no direct information as to
whether this assault has anything to do with the death of Libyan born al Qai'da
leader Abu Yahya al- Libi, but they are pursuing this theme. These officials do

believe that the attackers having prepared to launch their assault took advantage of
the cover provided by the demonstrations in Benghazi protesting an intemet
production seen as disrespectful to the prophet Mohammed.
2. According to this source, the immediate events were set in motion by a
statement made by a Muslim Cleric in Egypt saying that the internet film was
going to be shown across the United States on September 11 in an effort to insult
Muslims on the anniversary of the attacks on the New York World Trade Center in
2001. This statement inspired increasingly hostile demonstrations at the U.S.
Embassy in Cairo, and at diplomatic facilities in Libya. In Benghazi, reporting
from security sources states, approximately twenty one (21) Ansar al Sharia
fighters left their base in East Benghazi just after sundown infiltrated the crowd of
about 2,000 demonstrators at the U.S. Consulate. These forces, operating under
cover of darkness, opened fire on the consulate, eventually setting it on fire with
rocket propelled grenades. These fighters then withdrew to their camp. El
Magariaf ordered security officials to identify and arrest the attackers, adding that
he had been in touch with Egyptian President Mohm_med Morsi, and the two
agreed that their intelligence and security personnel will cooperate in this matter.
(Note: Some of the Libyan officials believe that the entire demonstration was
organized as cover for the attack, however; they point out that there is no evidence
of such a complex operation at this time.
3.(Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Libyan security
officers also informed el Magariaf that the attacks had been planned for
approximately one month, based on casing information obtained during an early
demonstration at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. The attackers were, in the
opinion of these individuals, looking for an opportunity to approach the consulate

under cover in a crowd. These officials add that government security officers
admitted to el Magariaf that they do not have the physical capacity to locate,
attack, and destroy the Ansar al-Sharia brigade, among others. They describe these
forces as well-trained, hardened killers; many of whom have spent time in
Afghanistan and Yemen. These fighters are located in camps in Eastern Libya; and
Libyan officials doubt they can penetrate these camps because the militia's are
better armed than the forces of the new National Army.
4. In the opinion of a separate source El Magariaf continues to believe that
the attacks were planned and carried out in a political atmosphere where a portion
of the Libyan population is focused on past cooperation between Western
intelligence and security services, and the regime of former dictator Muammar al
Qaddafi. According to this source, el Magariaf realizes that the death of the U.S.
Ambassador dictates that he must find tangible solutions to the problems tied to
disarming the militias, dealing Salafist violence against the followers of Sufi
beliefs, and efforts to discredit his government through linking him to Western
intelligence services. El Magariaf instructed his security officials to cooperate
with their U.S. counterparts. He also warned all of his advisors to be prepared for
U.S. retaliation against the suspected perpetrators of this attack, and the angry
public reaction that is sure to follow.
5. (Source Comment: A separate, particularly sensitive source added that in
private conversation el Magariaf stated that if his government cannot protect a
senior diplomatic official, foreign businesses will not be willing to risk opening up
new operations in Libya. According to this sensitive source, el Magariaf believes
that a number of the Islamist militias are now being influenced al Qai'da and other
radical groups; working out of camps in the Eastern and Southeastern parts of the

country. These groups are receiving aid and weapons from supporters in Sudan.
In the end, el Magariaf added that while he does not expect U.S. officials to focus
on this point, he believes the attacks against the interests and citizens of the U.S.
and other Western states are aimed first at overthrowing his government, and
replacing it with a strict Islamic Republic dominated by Salafist leaders. Magariaf
also warned that tribal militias loyal to the Qaddaft family continue to present an
equally dangerous threat to the new Government.)

Subject: AbZ and Hb3 on Libya and West Bank/Gaza
(SBU) I had back-to-back phone calls this morning from Qatari PM/FM Hamad bin Jassim and UAE Foreign
Minister Abdullah bin Zayed. The content was virtually identical, su esting either rare coincidence or, more
likely, an unusual level of UAE-Qatari coordination at yesterday's Arab League meeting. Main points (mostly
Libya related but one Palestinian-related) are as follows:
(SBU) No-Fly Zone: The Arab League has now called for a NFZ; the UNSC needs to act. Syria was the last hold-
out, but the resolution passed. Time is wasting. Both HbJ and AbZ made the right kind of noises (but still less
than a solid commitment) that there would be some kind of Qatari and Emirati participation in an
international effort. Their chicken-and-egg question to me was, are we going to support a NFZ? If we are,
then we can talk about the other participation.
(SBU) Recognizing the Council: Both urged us to do so. I noted that the Arab League statement fell short of
recognition. They urged us to find some kind of language that would suggest moving in that direction, and I
noted our decisions to suspend the operations of the Libyan Embassy, have S meet with Mahmoud Jibril of the
Council, and send a diplomatic representative to Benghazi. They pushed for more, with HbJ going to far as to
say that recognition of the Council will help underscore to Qadhafi and his circle that he's finished.
(SBU) Jibril meeting: They each said the same thing that Gene Cretz has picked up separately, that Jibril
doesn't want media for his meeting with S unless he feels that there will be something significant out of the
meeting. HbJ is providing a plane for Jibril to get to Paris. HbJ more than AbZ agreed with me that the
meeting itself is a significant deliverable; AbZ urged us not to be slower or quieter than France.
(SBU) West Bank/Gaza: Both reacted negatively to Israeli announcements regarding ""hundreds of houses"" in
the West Bank. They asked if we were going to say anything; I noted we were still at this point getting the
facts. ""Jeff, you guys just aren't serious,"" AbZ complained. I noted the political context, in which a family was
brutally murdered.

SUBJECT: Libya (37)
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional
Council, as well as the highest levels of European Governments, and Western
Intelligence and security services.
THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION COMES FROM AN EXTREMELY
SENSITIVE SOURCE AND SHOULD BE HANDLED WITH CARE.
1. On September 12, 2012 Libyan President Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf
told senior advisors that the death of the U.S. Ambassador at the hands of Islamist
militia forces represents a threat to the future of the newly elected General National
Congress (GNC) Government. According to a sensitive source, el Magariaf
believes that the primary goal of this and other attacks on Western facilities is to
demonstrate that the GNC cannot protect its non-Islamic friends. Libyan security
officials believe that the attack was carried out by forces of the Islamist militia
group calling itself the Ansar al Sharia brigade; working out of camps in the
Eastern suburbs of Benghazi. These officials added that their sources indicate that
this group is led by former members of the old Libyan Islamic Fighting Group
(LIFG), some of whom are loyal to Islamist General Abdelhaldm Belhaj. The
same officials were quick to point out that they have no evidence that Belhaj had
any direct involvement in this attack. They also have no direct information as to
whether this assault has anything to do with the death of Libyan born al Qarda
leader Abu Yahya al- Libi, but they are pursuing this theme. These officials do

believe that the attackers having prepared to launch their assault took advantage of
the cover provided by the demonstrations in Benghazi protesting an internet
production seen as disrespectful to the prophet Mohammed.
2 According to this source, the immediate events were set in motion by a
statement made by a Muslim Cleric in Egypt saying that the intemet film was
going to be shown across the United States on September 11 in an effort to insult
Muslims on the anniversary of the attacks on the New York World Trade Center in
2001. This statement inspired increasingly hostile demonstrations at the U.S.
Embassy in Cairo, and at diplomatic facilities in Libya. In Benghazi, reporting
from security sources states, approximately twenty one (21) Ansar al Sharia
fighters left their base in East Benghazi just after sundown infiltrated the crowd of
about 2,000 demonstrators at the U.S. Consulate. These forces, operating under
cover of darkness, opened fire on the consulate, eventually setting it on fire with
rocket propelled grenades. These fighters then withdrew to their camp. El
Magariaf ordered security officials to identify and arrest the attackers, adding that
he had been in touch with Egyptian President Mohmmed Morsi, and the two
agreed that their intelligence and security personnel will cooperate in this matter.
(Note: Some of the Libyan officials believe that the entire demonstration was
organized as cover for the attack, however; they point out that there is no evidence
of such a complex operation at this time.
3. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Libyan security
officers also informed el Magariaf that the attacks had been planned for
approximately one month, based on casing information obtained during an early
demonstration at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. The attackers were, in the
opinion of these individuals, looking for an opportunity to approach the consulate

under cover in a crowd. These officials add that government security officers
admitted to el Magariaf that they do not have the physical capacity to locate,
attack, and destroy the Ansar al-Sharia brigade, among others. They describe these
forces as well-trained, hardened killers; many of whom have spent time in
Afghanistan and Yemen. These fighters are located in camps in Eastern Libya; and
Libyan officials doubt they can penetrate these camps because the militia's are
better armed than the forces of the new National Army.
4. In the opinion of a separate source El Magariaf continues to believe that
the attacks were planned and carried out in a political atmosphere where a portion
of the Libyan population is focused on past cooperation between Western
intelligence and security services, and the regime of former dictator Muammar al
Qadclafi. According to this source, el Magariaf realizes that the death of the U.S.
Ambassador dictates that he must find tangible solutions to the problems tied to
disarming the militias, dealing Salafist violence against the followers of Sufi
beliefs, and efforts to discredit his government through linking him to Western
intelligence services. El Magariaf instructed his security officials to cooperate
with their U.S. counterparts. He also warned all of his advisors to be prepared for
U.S. retaliation against the suspected perpetrators of this attack, and the angry
public reaction that is sure to follow.
5. (Source comment: A separate, particularly sensitive source added that in
private conversation el Magariaf stated that if his government cannot protect a
senior diplomatic official, foreign businesses will not be willing to risk opening up
new operations in Libya. According to this sensitive source, el Magariaf believes
that a number of the Islamist militias are now being influenced al Qarcla and other
radical groups; working out of camps in the Eastern and Southeastern parts of the

In the end, el Magariaf added that while he does not expect U.S. officials to focus
on this point, he believes the attacks against the interests and citizens of the U.S.
and other Western states are aimed first at overthrowing his government, and
replacing it with a strict Islamic Republic dominated by Salafist leaders. Magariaf
also warned that tribal militias loyal to the Qaddafi family continue to present an
equally dangerous threat to the new Goverment.)

By Anne-Marie Slaughter
PRESIDENT Obama says the noose is tightening around Col. Muammar al-Qaddafi. In fact, it is
tightening around the Libyan rebels, as Colonel Qaddafi makes the most of the world's dithering and
steadily retakes rebel-held tow.ns, The United States and Europe are temporizing on a no-flight zone
while the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the Gulf Cooperation Council and now the Arab
League have all called on the United Nations Security Council to authorize one. Opponents of a no-
flight zone have put forth five main arguments, none of which, on closer examination, hold up.
It's not in our interest. Gen. Wesley K. Clark argues that ""Libya doesn't sell much oil to the United
States"" and that while Americans ""want to support democratic movements in the region,"" they are
already doing that in Iraq and Afghanistan. Framing this issue in terms of oil is exactly what Arab
populations and indeed much of the world expect, which is why they are so cynical about our
professions of support for democracy and human rights. Now we have a chance to support a new
beginning in the Muslim world â€” a new beginning of accountable governments that can provide
services and opportunities for their citizens in ways that could dramatically decrease support for
terrorist groups and violent extremism. It's hard to imagine something more in our strategic interest.
It will be counter-productive. Many thoughtful commentators, including Al Jazeera's director
general, Wadah Khanfar, argue that what is most important about the Arab spring is that it is coming
from Arabs themselves. From this perspective, Western military intervention will play right into
Qaddati's hands, allowing him to broadcast pictures of Western bombs falling on Arab civilians. But
these arguments, while important, must be weighed against the appeals of of Libyan opposition
fighters asking for international help, and now, astonishingly, against support for a no-flight zone by
some of the same governments that have kept their populations quiescent by holding up the specter of
foreign intervention. Assuming that a no-flight zone can be imposed by an international coalition that
includes Arab states, we have an opportunity to establish a new narrative of Western support for Arab
democrats.

It won't work. The United States ambassador to NATO, Ivo H. Daaider, argues that stopping
Colonel Qaddafi's air force will not be decisive; he will continue to inflict damage with tanks and
helicopters, bombing oil refineries and depots on his way to retaking key towns. But the potential
effect of a no-flight zone must also be assessed in terms of Colonel Qaddafi's own calculations about
his future. Richard Downie of the Center for Strategic and International Studies argues that although
Colonel Qaddafi cultivates a mad-dictator image, he has been a canny survivor and political
manipulator for 40 years. He is aware of debates with regard to a no-flight zone and is timing his
military campaign accordingly; he is also capable of using his air force just enough to gain strategic
advantage, but not enough to trigger a no-flight zone. If the international community lines up against
him and is willing to crater his runways and take out his antiaircraft weapons, he might well renew his
offer of a negotiated departure.
If it does work, we don't know what we will get. Revolutions are almost always followed by internal
divisions among the revolutionaries. We should not expect a rosy, Jeffersonian Libya. But the choice
is between uncertainty and the certainty that if Colonel Qaddafi wins, regimes acrosS the region will
conclude that force is the livay to answer protests. And when Colonel Qaddafi massacres the
opposition, young protesters across the Middle East will conclude that when we were asked to support
their cause with more than words, we blinked. Americans in turn will read the words of Mr. Obama's
June 2009 speech in Cairo., with its lofty promises to stand for universal human rights, and cringe.
Let's arm the rebels instead. Some commentators who agree with the analysis above say we could
'better accomplish our goals by providing intelligence and arms to the opposition. That would, of
course, be much easier for us. It undoubtedly appeals to Mn Obama as a neat compromise between
the desire to help the protesters and the desire not to overrule his defense secretary's reluctance to
participate in a no-flight zone. But we would be providing arms not to a disciplined military, but to
ragged groups of brave volunteers who barely know how to use the weapons they have. They need
action that will change the situation on. the ground for Colonel Qaddafi, as well as his the calculations.
Moreover, by the time arms and intelligence could take effect, it is quite likely that Colonel Qaddafi
will have retaken or at least besieged .Benghazi, the opposition stronghold.
The United States should immediately ask the Security Council to authorize a no-flight zOne and
make clear to Russia and China that if they block the resolution, the blood of the Libyan opposition
will be on their hands. We should push them at least to abstain and bring the issue to a vote as soon as
possible. If we get a resolution, we should work with the Arab League to quickly assemble an
international coalition to impose the no-flight zone. If the Security Council fails toact, then we should
recognize the opposition Interim National Council as the legitimate Libyan government, as France has
done, and work with the Arab League to give the council any assistance it requests:

It undoubtedly appeals to Mn Obama as a neat compromise betweenthe desire to help the protesters and the desire not to overrule his defense secretary's reluctance toparticipate in a no-flight zone. But we would be providing arms not to a disciplined military, but toragged groups of brave volunteers who barely know how to use the weapons they have. They needaction that will change the situation on. the ground for Colonel Qaddafi, as well as his the calculations.Moreover, by the time arms and intelligence could take effect, it is quite likely that Colonel Qaddafiwill have retaken or at least besieged .Benghazi, the opposition stronghold.The United States should immediately ask the Security Council to authorize a no-flight zOne andmake clear to Russia and China that if they block the resolution, the blood of the Libyan oppositionwill be on their hands. We should push them at least to abstain and bring the issue to a vote as soon aspossible. If we get a resolution, we should work with the Arab League to quickly assemble aninternational coalition to impose the no-flight zone. If the Security Council fails toact, then we shouldrecognize the opposition Interim National Council as the legitimate Libyan government, as France hasdone, and work with the Arab League to give the council any assistance it requests:UNCLASSIFIEDU.S. Department of StateCase No. F-2015-04841Doc No. C05739568Date: 05/13/2015STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Jake -- I was so moved by Hillary's powerful presence today on the screen as I watched along with millions in America
and around the world. She was emphathetic and unflinching and inspiring; she was wise and steady and strong. My 80
year old mother called from LA to say ""She was like our rock of Gibraltar"". What greater compliment for the Secretary of

SUBJECT: Libya (37)
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional
Council, as well as the highest levels of European Governments, and Western
Intelligence and security services.
THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION COMES FROM AN EXTREMELY
SENSITIVE SOURCE AND SHOULD BE HANDLED WITH CARE,
1. On September 12, 2012 Libyan President Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf
told senior advisors that the death of the U.S. Ambassador at the hands of Islamist
militia forces represents a threat to the future of the newly elected General National
Congress (GNC) Government. According to a sensitive source, el Magariaf
believes that the primary goal of this and other attacks on Western facilities is to
demonstrate that the GNC cannot protect its non-Islamic friends. Libyan security
officials believe that the attack was carried out by forces of the Islamist militia
group calling itself the Ansar al Sharia brigade; working out of camps in the
Eastern suburbs of Benghazi. These officials added that their sources indicate that
this group is led by former members of the old Libyan Islamic Fighting Group
(LIFG), some of whom are loyal to Islamist General Abclelhakim Belhaj. The
same officials were quick to point out that they have no evidence that Belhaj had
any direct involvement in this attack. They also have no direct information as to
whether this assault has anything to do with the death of Libyan born al Qai'da
leader Abu Yahya al- Libi, but they are pursuing this theme. These officials do

believe that the attackers having prepared to launch their assault took advantage of
the cover provided by the demonstrations in Benghazi protesting an internet
production seen as disrespectful to the prophet Mohammed.
2. According to this source, the immediate events were set in motion by a
statement made by a Muslim Cleric in Egypt saying that the interne film was
going to be shown across the United States on September 11 in an effort to insult
Muslims on the anniversary of the attacks on the New York World Trade Center in
2001. This statement inspired increasingly hostile demonstrations at the U.S.
Embassy in Cairo, and at diplomatic facilities in Libya. In Benghazi, reporting
from security sources states, approximately twenty one (21) Ansar al Sharia
fighters left their base in East Benghazi just after sundown infiltrated the crowd of
about 2,000 demonstrators at the U.S. Consulate. These forces, operating under
cover of darkness, opened fire on the consulate, eventually setting it on fire with
rocket propelled grenades. These fighters then withdrew to their camp. El
Magariaf ordered security officials to identify and arrest the attackers, adding that
he had been in touch with Egyptian President Mohmmed Morsi, and the two
agreed that their intelligence and security personnel will cooperate in this matter.
(Note: Some of the Libyan officials believe that the entire demonstration was
organized as cover for the attack, however; they point out that there is no evidence
of such a complex operation at this time.
3. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Libyan security
officers also informed el Magariaf that the attacks had been planned for
approximately one month, based on casing information obtained during an early
demonstration at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. The attackers were, in the
opinion of these individuals, looking for an opportunity to approach the consulate

under cover in a crowd. These officials add that government security officers
admitted to el Magariaf that they do not have the physical capacity to locate,
attack, and destroy the Ansar al-Sharia brigade, among others. They describe these
forces as well-trained, hardened killers; many of whom have spent time in
Afghanistan and Yemen. These fighters are located in camps in Eastern Libya; and
Libyan officials doubt they can penetrate these camps because the militia's are
better armed than the forces of the new National Army.
4. In the opinion of a separate source El Magariaf continues to believe that
the attacks were planned and carried out in a political atmosphere where a portion
of the Libyan population is focused on past cooperation between Western
intelligence and security services, and the regime of former dictator Muammar al
Qaddafi. According to this source, el Magariaf realizes that the death of the U.S.
Ambassador dictates that he must find tangible solutions to the problems tied to
disarming the militias, dealing Salafist violence against the followers of Sufi
beliefs, and efforts to discredit his government through linking him to Western
intelligence services. El Magariaf instructed his security officials to cooperate
with their U.S. counterparts. He also warned all of his advisors to be prepared for
U.S. retaliation against the suspected perpetrators of this attack, and the angry
public reaction that is sure to follow.
5. (Source Comment: A separate, particularly sensitive source added that in
private conversation el Magariaf stated that if his government cannot protect a
senior diplomatic official, foreign businesses will not be willing to risk opening up
new operations in Libya. According to this sensitive source, el Magariaf believes
that a number of the Islamist militias are now being influenced al Qai'da and other
radical groups; working out of camps in the Eastern and Southeastern parts of the

country. These groups are receiving aid and weapons from supporters in Sudan.
In the end, el Magariaf added that while he does not expect U.S. officials to focus
on this point, he believes the attacks against the interests and citizens of the U.S.
and other Western states are aimed first at overthrowing his government, and
replacing it with a strict Islamic Republic dominated by Salafist leaders. Magariaf
also warned that tribal militias loyal to the Qaddafi family continue to present an
equally dangerous threat to the new Government.)

1. During the afternoon of September 11, 2012 new interim President of Libya
Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf spoke in private with senior advisors, including the
members of the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood, to discuss the attacks by demonstrators
on U.S. missions in Tripoli and Benghazi. According to a sensitive source, el Magariaf
was shaken by the attacks, and gave permission to commanders on the ground for
security forces to open fire over the heads of the crowds in an effort to break up mobs
attacking the missions. During this session, a senior security officer told el Magariaf
that the attacks on that day were inspired by what many devout Libyan viewed as a

sacrilegious internet video on the prophet Mohammed originating in America. The
Libyan attacks were also inspired by and linked to an attack on the U.S. mission in
Egypt on the same day. At the same time, el Magariaf noted in strong terms that the
atmosphere that made fostered these incidents in Libya is the product of widespread
publicity regarding the security situation in the country between 2004 and 2010 and
the cooperation that developed between a number of Western Intelligence services and
the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi.
2. This source added that el Magariafs advisors believe that this situation adds
to the President's growing concern over the unpredictable effects that will follow
current covert efforts by his political opponents to link him directly to foreign
intelligence services. According to a separate sensitive source, el Magariaf noted that
his opponents had often tried to connect him to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) through the National Front for the Salvation of Libya (NFSL), a group
established in opposition to former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi, which el Magariaf
led in the 1980s. In the opinion of this individual el Magariaf believes that he can

develop in this manner it will complicate his efforts to establish an orderly
administration in the country. Again, he stated that the attacks on the U.S. missions
were as much a result of the atmosphere created by this campaign, as the controversial
internet video.
3. At the same time, this individual noted that several of el Magariafs advisors
share his concerns in this matter, pointing out that the return of Qaddafi's intelligence
chief Abdullah al-Seno-ussi for trial in Libya has heightened public interest in the
liaison relationships conducted by the CIA and British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS)
with Qaddfi's intelligence and security services. These same individuals note that they
believe Islamist militia forces under the command of General Abdelhaldm Belhaj
captured files and documents describing this relationship from Qaddafi's offices in
Tripoli. This fascination with Western intelligence operations in Qaddafi's Libya is also
driven by Human Rights Watch (HRW) and its efforts to tie Western governments to
human rights violations committed under Qaddafi. In this regard HRW has
interviewed at least fourteen (14) individuals claiming that they were turned over to
Qaddafi's forces by the Western powers. Belhaj is included in this group.
4. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el Magariafs
enemies are working to take advantage of his suspected links to the CIA at a time when
Western intelligence services are under scrutiny in Libya. They also fear that this
situation will only grow more complex as Qaddafi's son Saif al Islam Qaddafi and al
Senousi are brought before Libyan courts to answer for their crimes under the old
regime, particularly during the 2011 revolution. These individuals believe both men
will be linked to Western Intelligence during their trials. )

Brotherhood and other Islamist groups to defuse this situation. He is particularly

concerned by the level of violence between Sufi Muslims and Salafists, and believes he
must maintain his reputation for impartiality if he is to defuse this growing problem.
As he works to organize the government, and disarm the militias, he cannot afford to
lose the respect and trust of the Libyan people, especially at a time when cultural
clashes between followers of the mystical Sufi tradition and ultra-conservative Salafis
have taken central stage in the new Libya. This source adds that these religious
conflicts were largely unknown during Qaddafi's rule.
6. (Source Comment: This source added that the individuals interviewed for the
HRW report were former members of the Libyan Islamist Fighting Group (LIFG), an
Islamist group formed in opposition to Gaddafi's controversial interpretations of Islam.
These LIFO fighters fled the country in the late 198os and went to Afghanistan to join
the fight against the Soviet Union while also gaining training and experience for their
own struggle. A separate source adds that messages to Libya from the CIA and SIS
were found among the Tripoli Documents published by HRW, indicating that the
United States and Britain were eager to help Libya capture several senior LIFG figures,
including its co-founders, Belhaj and Sarni al-Saadi.)
7. As Libyan authorities struggle to control the armed rings that refuse to
surrender weapons following last year's civil war, Salafis, who say Islam should return
to the simple ways followed by Mohammed, have established their own armed gangs in
post-Gaddafi Libya. They view Sufi practices as idolatrous. Since the start of the Arab
Spring uprising across the region, a number of Sufi sites have been attacked in Egypt,
Mali and Libya. Magariaf is determined to establish a democratic state based on
Islamic principles. This individual adds that Magariaf remains dedicated to the idea of
building a tolerant Islamic state in Libya. El Magariafs opinions continue to be shaped
by his experience with Qaddafl, whom he felt built a cult of personality in violation of
all of the basic ideas of Islam.

Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf spoke in private with senior advisors, including the
members of the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood, to discuss the attacks by demonstrators

attacking the missions. During this session, a senior security officer told el Magariaf
that the attacks on that day were inspired by what many devout Libyan viewed as a
sacrilegious internet video on the prophet Mohammed originating in America. The
Libyan attacks were also inspired by and linked to an attack on the U.S. mission in
Egypt on the same day. At the same time, el Magariaf noted in strong terms that the
atmosphere that made fostered these incidents in Libya is the product of widespread
publicity regarding the security situation in the country between 2004 and 2010 and
the cooperation that developed between a number of Western Intelligence services and
the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi.
2. This source added that el Magariafs advisors believe that this situation adds
to the President's growing concern over the unpredictable effects that will follow
current covert efforts by his political opponents to link him directly to foreign
intelligence services. According to a separate sensitive source, el Magariaf noted that
his opponents had often tried to connect him to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) through the National Front for the Salvation of Libya (NFSL), a group
established in opposition to former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi, which el Magariaf
led in the 198 OS. In the opinion of this individual el Magariaf believes that he can
survive potential negative publicity in this regard, but if this situation continues to
develop in this manner it will complicate his efforts to establish an orderly
administration in the country. Again, he stated that the attacks on the U.S. missions
were as much a result of the atmosphere created by this campaign, as the controversial
internet video.
3. At the same time, this individual noted that several of el Magariafs advisors
share his concerns in this matter, pointing out that the return of Qaddafi's intelligence
chief Abdullah al-Senoussi for trial in Libya has heightened public interest in the
liaison relationships conducted by the CIA and British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS)
with Qaddfi's intelligence and security services. These same individuals note that they
believe Islamist militia forces under the command of General Abdelhakim Belhaj
captured files and documents describing this relationship from Qaddafi's offices in
Tripoli. This fascination with Western intelligence operations in Qaddafi's Libya is also

Re: More Magariaf private reax
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1.On September 12, 2012 Libyan President Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf told senior
advisors that the death of the U.S. Ambassador at the hands of Islamist militia forces represents a
threat to the future of the newly elected General National Congress (GNC) Government According to
a sensitive source, el Magariaf believes that the primary goal of this and other attacks on Western
facilities is to demonstrate that the GNC cannot protect its non-Islamic friends. Libyan security
officials believe that the attack was carried out by forces of the Islamist militia group calling itself the
Ansar al Sharia brigade; working out of camps in the Eastern suburbs of Benghazi. These officials
added that their sources indicate that this group is led by former members of the old Libyan Islamic
Fighting Group (LIFG), some of whom are loyal to Islamist General Abdelhakirn Belhaj. The same
officials were quick to point out that they have no evidence that Belhaj had any direct involvement in
this attack. They also have no direct information as to whether this assault has anything to do with
the death of Libyan born al Qai'da leader Abu Yahya al- Libi, but they are pursuing this theme. These
officials do believe that the attackers having prepared to launch their assault took advantage of the
cover provided by the demonstrations in Benghazi protesting an internet production seen as
disrespectful to the prophet Mohammed.
2. According to this source, the immediate events were set in motion by a statement made by a
Muslim Cleric in Egypt saying that the internet film was going to be shown across the United States
on September 11 in an effort to insult Muslims on the anniversary of the attacks on the New York
World Trade Center in 2001. This statement inspired increasingly hostile demonstrations at the U.S.

Embassy in Cairo, and at diplomatic facilities in Libya. In Benghazi, reporting from security sources
states, approximately twenty one (21) Ansar al Sharia fighters left their base in East Benghazi just
after sundown infiltrated the crowd of about 2,000 demonstrators at the U.S. Consulate. These
forces, operating under cover of darkness, opened fire on the consulate, eventually setting it on fire
with rocket propelled grenades. These fighters then withdrew to their camp. El Magariaf ordered
security officials to identify and arrest the attackers, adding that he had been in touch with Egyptian
President Mohmmed Morsi, and the two agreed that their intelligence and security personnel will
cooperate in this matter. (Note: Some of the Libyan officials believe that the entire demonstration was
organized as cover for the attack, however; they point out that there is no evidence of such a complex
operation at this time.
3. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Libyan security officers also informed
el Magariaf that the attacks had been planned for approximately one month, based on casing
information obtained during an early demonstration at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. The attackers
were, in the opinion of these individuals, looking for an opportunity to approach the consulate under
cover in a crowd. These officials add that government security officers admitted to el Magariaf that
they do not have the physical capacity to locate, attack, and destroy the Ansar al-Sharia brigade,
among others. They describe these forces as well-trained, hardened killers; many of whom have spent
time in Afghanistan and Yemen. These fighters are located in camps in Eastern Libya; and Libyan
officials doubt they can penetrate these camps because the militia's are better armed than the forces
of the new National Army.
4. In the opinion of a separate source El Magariaf continues to believe that the attacks were
planned and carried out in a political atmosphere where a portion of the Libyan population is focused
on past cooperation between Western intelligence and security services, and the regime of former
dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. According to this source, el Magariaf realizes that the death of the U.S.
Ambassador dictates that he must find tangible solutions to the problems tied to disarming the
militias, dealing Salafist violence against the followers of Sufi beliefs, and efforts to discredit his
government through linking him to Western intelligence services. El Magariaf instructed his security
officials to cooperate with their U.S. counterparts. He also warned all of his advisors to be prepared
for U.S. retaliation against the suspected perpetrators of this attack, and the angry public reaction that
is sure to follow.
5. (Source Comment: A separate, particularly sensitive source added. that in private
conversation el Magariaf stated that if his government cannot protect a senior diplomatic official,
foreign businesses will not be willing to risk opening up new operations in Libya. According to this
sensitive source, el Magariaf believes that a number of the Islamist militias are now being influenced
al Qai'da and other radical groups; working out of camps in the Eastern and Southeastern parts of the
country. These groups are receiving aid and weapons from supporters in Sudan. In the end, el
Magariaf added that while he does not expect U.S. officials to focus on this point, he believes the
attacks against the interests and citizens of the U.S. and other Western states are aimed first at
overthrowing his government, and replacing it with a strict Islamic Republic dominated by Salafist
leaders. Magariaf also warned that tribal militias loyal to the Qaddafi family continue to present an
equally dangerous threat to the new Government.)

These officials add that government security officersadmitted to el Magariaf that they do not have the physical capacity to locate, attack, and destroythe Ansar al-Sharia brigade, among others. They describe these forces as well-trained, hardenedkillers; many of whom have spent time in Afghanistan and Yemen. These fighters are located incamps in Eastern Libya; and Libyan officials doubt they can penetrate these camps because themilitia's are better armed than the forces of the new National Army.4. In the opinion of a separate source El Magariaf continues to believe that the attackswere planned and carried out in a political atmosphere where a portion of the Libyan populationis focused on past cooperation between Western intelligence and security services, and theregime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. According to this source, el Magariaf realizesthat the death of the U.S. Ambassador dictates that he must find tangible solutions to theproblems tied to disarming the militias, dealing Salafist violence against the followers of Sufibeliefs, and efforts to discredit his government through linking him to Western intelligenceservices. El Magariaf instructed his security officials to cooperate with their U.S. counterparts.He also warned all of his advisors to be prepared for U.S. retaliation against the suspectedperpetrators of this attack, and the angry public reaction that is sure to follow.5. (Source Comment: A separate, particularly sensitive source added that in privateconversation el Magariaf stated that if his government cannot protect a senior diplomatic official,foreign businesses will not be willing to risk opening up new operations in Libya. According tothis sensitive source, el Magariaf believes that a number of the Islamist militias are now beinginfluenced al Qai'da and other radical groups; working out of camps in the Eastern andSoutheastern parts of the country. These groups are receiving aid and weapons from supportersin Sudan. In the end, el Magariaf added that while he does not expect U.S. officials to focus onthis point, he believes the attacks against the interests and citizens of the U.S. and other Westernstates are aimed first at overthrowing his government, and replacing it with a strict IslamicRepublic dominated by Salafist leaders. Magariaf also warned that tribal militias loyal to theQaddafi family continue to present an equally dangerous threat to the new Government.)UNCLASSIFIEDU.S. Department of StateCase No. F-2015-04841Doc No. C05739587Date: 05/13/2015STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

What should we make of the attacks on the U.S. consulates in Egypt, Libya and Yemen, and the deaths of
four Americans, including U.S. ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens?
It depends on who you mean by ""we.""
From the perspective of those who stormed the embassies, taking down the American flag in Egypt and
replacing it with a black flag reading, ""There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is his messenger,"" theirs was
an act of justice on behalf of the One True Faith.
The Americans had it coming, according to this view, because Americans are on the wrong side in the clash of
civilizations between the Judeo-Christian West and the Muslim world. And the creation of an anti-Islamic video
(ironically entitled ""Innocence of Muslims"") by a producer thought to be an American provided the catalyst
(or excuse) for the protests.
Why Muslims are sensitive about portraying the Prophet Mohammed
Most Americans operate by a different ""we."" From our perspective, the assault was an unjust and cowardly
attack on (among other things) the rule of law, the institution of diplomacy and the right of free speech.
Libyan Deputy Prime Minister Mustafa Abushagur gave voice to this perspective when he said on Twitter, ""I
condemn these barbaric attacks in the strongest possible terms. This is an attack on America, Libya and free
people everywhere.""
""Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the
Internet,"" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton added. ""The United States deplores any intentional effort to
denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning
of our nation.""
In a commencement speech at Kenyon College in 2005, later published as""This Is Water,"" novelist David
Foster Wallace urged student to scrutinize the ""natural, basic self-centeredness"" that puts ""me"" at the center of
the world.
This unconscious ""default setting"" fosters the sort of ""blind certainty"" that manifests as arrogant atheism and
fundamentalism alike, Wallace said. And the point of education is to shake us out of that ""default setting"" â€” to
begin to see things from the perspectives of others.

According to those who stormed the embassies, ""Innocence of Muslims"" was not made by an individual
(whoever the shadowy ""Sam Bacile"" may â€” or may not â€” be). It was made by anAmerican.
Moreover, according to this groupthink, Americans as a group are responsible for the sins of individual
Americans, so it makes perfect sense to strike out at embassy personnel who issued a statement before the
protests turned deadly, condemning ""the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious
feelings of Muslims, as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions.""

Meanwhile, the shadowy figures who produced and distributed ""Innocence of Muslims"" are imprisoned in some
groupthink of their own, which gathers all the world's Muslims under the category of an evil Islamic empire.
Their film doesn't just depict Mohammed as a con man, philanderer, and pedophile. It portrays his followers as
dupes.
Unfortunately, the events of recent days have done nothing to jar the alleged producer out of this default setting.
When questioned about his film in the aftermath of the Libyan and Egyptian attacks, a man identifying himself
as ""Sam Bacile"" reportedly told the Wall Street Journal that ""Islam is a cancer.""
You don't need a Kenyon college degree to see how this vicious cycle of provocation and violence is fueled,
and you don't need to be a moral relativist to see that it takes two sides to keep it running.
I am an American who is justly proud of the First Amendment and its protections of freedom of speech and
religion. And I believe that killing your opponents in the name of God or nation is a far greater offense than
offending them with an ignorant movie.
Nonetheless, the root problem on display here is in my view what Wallace denounced as ""blind certainty.""
Our world is not divided first and foremost along religious or national lines, into Muslims and Christians and
Hindus or Israelis and Americans and Egyptians.
Neither is it divided into secularists and people of faith â€” the New Atheists and partisans of old-time religion.
The real ""red line"" in the modem world divides the certain from the uncertain. And in the tragic events of recent
days, those who produced and distributed this hateful movie stand on the same side of this line as the killers of
innocents in Libya and Egypt.
Both groups are possessed by the unholy spirit of ""blind certainty,"" unacquainted with both the complexity and
contradictions of life on Earth and the ""cloud of unknowing"" that hovers over every major religion.
The great religious thinkers in Judaism, Christianity and Islam always knew enough to know that they did not
know everything.
They knew the difference between the eternal decrees of the God of Abraham and the all-too-flawed thoughts of
ordinary people. They knew, in short, that they are not God, who alone is charged with creating and destroying
the world and discriminating along the way between the real and the illusory.
The killers in Libya have forgotten that. So have the not-so-innocent producers and distributors of Innocence
of Islam.""

Status update on the Chris Stevens mission to Benghazi:
The current game plan is for Mr. Stevens to move no later than Wednesday from Malta to Benghazi. He will stage off
shore initially for a one day visit during which he will have meetings with TNC interlocutors and get a sense of the
situation on the ground. The goal of this one day trip is for him to lay the groundwork for a stay of up to 30 days.
He will be accompanied by a DS team, a staff member from Embassy Tripoli and the leader of USAID's DART team. With
the support of Ambassador Cretz and Embassy Tripoli, Mr Stevens is in contact with TNC members on the ground in
Benghazi and elsewhere; the team is also in contact with other diplomatic missions and NGOs in Benghazi. We expect to
get support in particular from the Turks who have a consulate in Benghazi.
Mr. Stevens team has been in touch with Africom planners on the details of the mission. We have made the official
request for support from OSD but have yet to get approval. Once we have that â€” and we hope that will be very soon --
we will be able to move forward with the planning.

Hillary Clinton tries to calm anti-U.S.
sentiment as protesters storm embassy
in Yemen
By Debbi Wilgoren and Michael Birnbaum Updated: Thursday,
September 13, 11:06 AM
Secretary of State Hillary Rodharn Clinton on Thursday tried to distance the U.S.
government from a movie that has sparked protests throughout the Muslim world,
calling it ""disgusting and reprehensible"" but also condemning efforts to avenge the
movie through bloodshed.

""The U.S. government has absolutely nothing to do with this video. We absolutely
reject its content and messages,"" Clinton said. ""But there is no justification none
at all â€” for responding to this video with violence.""
Clinton spoke two days after U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three
other Americans were killed at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, an attack
that analysts was staged by militants to coincide with a demonstration against the
controversial movie. Protests denouncing the film have raged outside the U.S
Embassy in Egypt for three days, and demonstrators on Tuesday breached the walls
of that heavily guarded compound, pulled down an American flag and destroyed it.
In Sanaa, Yemen, hundreds of demonstrators converged on a usually-sealed-off
street in front of the embassy on Thursday for a protest that also turned violent,
witnesses said. Protesters stormed a wall, set fire to a building inside the compound,
broke windows and carried away office supplies and other souvenirs before being
pushed back and dispersed by Yemeni security forces.
""We want to expel the American ambassador,"" said Abdelwadood al-Mutawa, a
protester who was walking out of the embassy compound. He said he was
motivated by reports of the movie mocking the prophet Muhammad. ""We cannot
accept any insult to our prophet,"" Mutawa said. ""It's a red line.""
Another protester said that some of the security forces protecting the building
appeared sympathetic to the demonstrators' cause. ""Some soldiers were telling me,
'These are dogs, and we cannot accept insulting our prophet,' ""said Yusef
Mohammad.
Smaller protests were reported in front of diplomatic offices in Iran and outside a
mosque in Bangladesh.
Yemen's president, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, quickly issued an apology to the
United States, and ordered an investigation into incident.
""The Government of Yemen condemns any and all acts of violence against
diplomatic personnel and facilities,"" a statement from Yemen's government said.
""We strongly urge all those that would wish to incite others to violence to cease
immediately.""
But the violence in Yemen again raised questions about whether vulnerable Middle
East governments are willing or even able to protect American targets in their

countries. It was a further measure of the depth of anger about the film insulting the
prophet Muhammad, which was reportedly made in California, although much
about its origins remains unknown.
President Obama spoke by phone with Libyan President Mohamed Yusuf al-
Magariaf late Wednesday, accepting condolences for the American deaths in
Benghazi and expressing appreciation for the cooperation between the United States
and the people and government of Libya in the wake of the attack, the White House
said.
In Brussels, meanwhile, Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi on Thursday gave his
strongest condemnation yet of the attack on the Cairo embassy. He had issued only
tepid statements on Wednesday, and his Muslim Brotherhood organization had
called for further protests in front of the diplomatic compound.
Morsi said he condemned the security breach ""in the clearest terms.""
""I assured Barack Obama that we will not permit any attacks"" on U.S. diplomatic
compounds across Egypt, said Morsi, who is in Belgium for a visit to the European
Union.
But Morsi also denounced the anti-Islamic film that appears to have sparked many
of the protests, adding that he had spoken to Obama about it. ""I called him to ask
him to put an end to such behavior,"" Morsi said, referring to the making of the film.
In her remarks, made in Washington during an appearance with the Moroccan
foreign minister, Clinton said the United States cannot and should not prevent
people from making films that express their opinions. Doing so, she emphasized,
would violate the country's staunch commitment to free and open speech.
""Now I know it is hard for some people to understand why the United States cannot
or does not just prevent these kinds of reprehensible videos from ever seeing the
light of day,"" Clinton said. ""... Even if it were possible, our country does have a
long tradition of free expression, which is enshrined in our Constitution and our
law. And we do not stop individual citizens from expressing their views, no matter
how distasteful they may be.""
Noting that countless generations of immigrants, including ""millions of Muslims""
have left other countries for the United States in order to enjoy those same

In Cairo on Thursday, security forces eventually pushed the demonstrators away
from the U.S. Embassy onto Tahrir Square â€” the crucial site of Egypt's 2011
revolution.
In Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, about 100 demonstrators burned an American
flag and chanted slogans on Thursday, including ""We won't accept mocking of
Prophet Muhammad"" and ""Down with American imperialism,"" Agence France
Press reported.
The news agency said the protesters were mostly seminary student. They gathered
outside the Baitul Mokarram Mosque, the largest in the country, but called for more
protests Friday and said the U.S. embassy could be the target. Bangladeshi police
told AFP that security at the embassy was being enhanced.
In Tehran, anti-American protesters gathered outside the Swiss Embassy, which

Re: Lots of new Intel; Libyan army possibly on verge of collapse
Latest:
During the evening of March 27, 2011, individuals with direct access to the military committee of the National
Libyan Council (NLC) stated in confidence that while the rebel forces continue to have organization and
communications problems, their morale has improved drastically, and they believe the Libyan Army is on the
verge of collapse. Under attack from allied Air and Naval forces, the Libyan Army troops have begun to desert
to the rebel side in increasing numbers. The rebels are making an effort togeet these troops as fellow Libyans,
in an effort to encourage additional defections.
(Source Comment: Speaking in strict confidence, one rebel commander stated that his troops continue to
summarily execute all foreign mercenaries captured in the fighting. At the same time Colonel Khalifa Haftzuâ€¢
has reportedly joined the rebel command structure, in an effort to help organization the rebel forces. Haftar was
the commander of the Libyan National Army ([NA), a 1500 man force of anti-Qaddafi troops based in
N'djamena, Chad, until current President Idryss Debi overthrew Chadian President Hussein Habre in the fall of
1990, with the assistance of Libyan and French troops. Haftar and his troops lied to a cotaatry in central Africa
and many, including Haftar, later settled in the United States.)
An extremely sensitive source added that the rebels are receiving direct assistance and training from a small
number of Egyptian Special Forces units, while French and British Special Operations troops are working out of
bases in Egypt, along the Libyan border. These troops are overseeing the transfer of weapons and supplies to
the rebels.

(Source Comment: The rebels are moving back into 'areas that they lost in mid- March fighting, and using the
allied air cover, they are confident they can move into the Tripoli district in a matter of days. One rebel source
reported that they had reliable intelligence that people were evacuating Qaddafi's hometown, Sirte, anticipating
its capture by the rebels. Sirte is located mid-way between Tripoli and Benghazi; its loss will be a
psychological blow for Qaddall.)
Separately, a sensitive European source stated in strict confidence that French military commanders anticipate a
complete collapse of the Libyan military command and control structure in the next week. These officers, who
have experience with the Libyan Army during its invasion of Chad in the late 1980s stated that the Libyan
troops did not perform well under concentrated fire from troops armed with modern weapons.
This source also noted that information from Tripoli has become increasingly difficult to obtain, but there are
reports of deaths among some Qaddafi's senior security officials, including Mansour Daw, and that the Libyan
leader himself may have experienced a health problem. Unfortunately, the European Intelligence services have
been unable to confirm or discredit these reports. This situation has become increasingly frustrating for French
President Nicolas Sarkozy, who, according to knowledgeable individuals, is pressing to have France emerge
from this crisis as the principal foreign ally of any new government that takes power.
Sarkozy is also concerned about continuing reports that radical/terrorist groups such as the Libyan Fighting
Groups and Al Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) are infiltrating the NLC. and its military command.
Accordingly, he asked sociologist who has long established ties to Israel, Syria, and other B6
nations in the Middle East, to use his contacts to determine the level of influence AQIM and other terrorist
groups have inside of the NLC. Sarkozy also asked for reports setting out a clear picture of the role of the
Muslim Brotherhood in the rebel leadership.
These sources note that French diplomats and intelligence officers in Egypt are in contact with the following
rebel figures in Benghazi:
MESMAR1Nouri (Qaddafi's former head of protocol, who along with Mousa Kousa was considered the Libyan
leaders most loyal follower. Noun currently lives in France;
.Gehan (GI-LEI-LAND Abdallah (colonel);
CHARRA.NT Faraj,
BOUKHRIS Fathi,
General Abdelfateh Younis (commander of the rebel forces)
(Source Comment: Senior European security officials caution that AQIM is watching developments in Libya,
and elements of that organization have been in touch with tribes in the southeastern part of the country. These
officials are concerned that in a post-Qaddafi Libya, France and other western European countries must move
quickly to ensure that the new government does not allow AQUA and others to set up small, semi- autonomous
local entitiesâ€”or ""Caliphates""â€”in the oil and gas producing regions of southeastern Libya.)
These knowledgeable sources add that the insurgents have the following weapons stockpiled in Benghazi:
82 and 120 mm. mortars;
GPZ type machine guns;
12.7mm. machine guns mounted on 4x4 vehicles;
some anti-aircraft batteries type ZSU 23/2 and 23/4 as well as Man-Portable Air-Defense Systems

American Killed in Libya Was on Intel Mission to Track Weapons
Before Death, Ex-SEAL Glen Doherty Told ABC News He Helped Round Up Dangerous
Shoulder-Fired Rockets
By LEE FERRAN
Sept. 13,2012
One of the Americans killed alongside Ambassador Christopher Stevens in an attack on a U.S. diplomatic
mission in Libya Tuesday told ABC News before his death that he was working with the State Department
on an intelligence mission to round up dangerous weapons in the war-torn nation.
In an interview with ABC News last month, Glen Doherty, a 42-year-old former Navy SEAL who worked as
a contractor with the State Department, said he personally went into the field to track down so-called
MANPADS, shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, and destroy them. After the fall of dictator Moammar
Gadhafi last year, the State Department launched a mission to round up thousands of MANPADS that may
have been looted from military installations across the country. U.S. officials previously told ABC
News they were concerned the MANPADS could fall into the hands of terrorists, creating a threat to
commercial airliners.

Doherty said that he traveled throughout Libya chasing reports of the weapons and once they were found,
his team would destroy them on the spot by bashing them with hammers or repeatedly running them over
with their vehicles. When ABC News spoke to Doherty in late August, he was enjoying a short time off in
California before heading back to Libya just days ago.

The State Department declined to comment on Doherty's involvement in the IVIANPADS program, but
pointed to a previous statement from State Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs Andrew
Shapiro in which he said the department was looking at ""every possible tool to mitigate the threat.""
According to military records provided to ABC News, Doherty joined the Navy in 1996 and was a combat
medic and a decorated member of the elite SEAL teams by the time he left active duty in 2004. He's
described in glowing terms as a top-tier SEAL and better friend in the book ""The Red Circle,"" written by
Doherty's longtime friend and SEAL sniper school partner, Brandon Webb.
""Glen was a superb and respected operator, a true quiet professional,"" Webb told ABC News today. ""Don't
feel sorry for him, he wouldn't have it. He died serving with men he respected, protecting the freedoms we
enjoy as Americans and doing something he loved. He was my best friend and one of the finest human
beings I've ever known.""
Doherty's mother, Barbara, told ABC News' Boston affiliate WCVB she had been notified of her son's death
late Wednesday.
""He was the most wonderful person,"" she said. ""We are all in pain and suffering.""
Ambassador Stevens and State Department information management officer Sean Smith were killed in the
first wave of attacks in Benghazi when the building they were in was set on fire around 10 p.m. local time
Tuesday, a senior administration official told reporters. Doherty was apparently one of two other
Americans who were killed in a firefight nearly two hours later, while the facility was still under attack.
The State Department has not officially released the names of those Americans.

Attached is full compilation. You never said spontaneous or characterized the motives, in fact you were careful in your
first statement to say we were assessing motive and method. The way you treated the video in the Libya context was to
say that some sought to *justify* the attack on that basis.

Statement on the Attack in Benghazi
September 11, 2012
I condemn in the strongest terms the attack on our mission in Benghazi today. As we work to
secure our personnel and facilities, we have confirmed that one of our State Department officers
was killed. We are heartbroken by this terrible loss. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family
and those who have suffered in this attack.
This evening, I called Libyan President Magariaf to coordinate additional support to protect
Americans in Libya. President Magariaf expressed his condemnation and condolences and
pledged his government's full cooperation.
Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted
on the Internet The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs
of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation.
But let me be clear: There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.
In light of the events of today, the United States government is working with partner countries
around the world to protect our personnel, our missions, and American citizens worldwide.
Statement on the Death of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya
September 12, 2012
It is with profound sadness that I share the news of the death of four American personnel in
Benghazi, Libya yesterday. Among them were United States Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens
and Foreign Service Information Management Officer, Sean Smith. We are still making next of
kin notifications for the other two individuals. Our hearts go out to all their families and
colleagues.
A 21 year veteran of the Foreign Service, Ambassador Stevens died last night from injuries he
sustained in the attack on our office in Benghazi.
I had the privilege of swearing in Chris for his post in Libya only a few months ago. He spoke
eloquently about his passion for service, for diplomacy and for the Libyan people. This
assignment was only the latest in his more than two decades of dedication to advancing closer
ties with the people of the Middle East and North Africa which began as a Peace Corps
Volunteer in Morocco. As the conflict in Libya unfolded, Chris was one of the first Americans
on the ground in Benghazi. He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to
build the foundation for a new, free nation. He spent every day since helping to finish the work
that he started. Chris was committed to advancing America's values and interests, even when
that meant putting himself in danger.
Sean Smith was a husband and a father of two, who joined the Department ten years ago. Like

Chris. Sean was one of our best. Prior to arriving in Benghazi, he served in Baghdad, Pretoria,
Montreal, and most recently The Hague.
All the Americans we lost in yesterday's attacks made the ultimate sacrifice. We condemn this
vicious and violent attack that took their lives, which they had committed to helping the Libyan
people reach for a better future.
America's diplomats and development experts stand on the front lines every day for our country.
We are honored by the service of each and every one of them.
Remarks on the Deaths of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya
September 12, 2012
Yesterday, our U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya was attacked. Heavily armed militants
assaulted the compound and set fire to our buildings. American and Libyan security personnel
battled the attackers together. Four Americans were killed. They included Sean Smith, a Foreign
Service information management officer, and our Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. We are
still making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals.
This is an attack that should shock the conscience of people of all faiths around the world. We
condemn in the strongest terms this senseless act of violence, and we send our prayers to the
families, friends, and colleagues of those we've lost.
All over the world, every day, America's diplomats and development experts risk their lives in
the service of our country and our values, because they believe that the United States must be a
force for peace and progress in the world, that these aspirations are worth striving and sacrificing
for. Alongside our men and women in uniform, they represent the best traditions of a bold and
generous nation.
In the lobby of this building, the State Department, the names of those vvho have fallen in the line
of duty are inscribed in marble. Our hearts break over each one. And now, because of this
tragedy, we have new heroes to honor and more friends to mourn.
Chris Stevens fell in love with the Middle East as a young Peace Corps volunteer teaching
English in Morocco. He joined the Foreign Service, learned languages, won friends for America
in distant places, and made other people's hopes his own.
In the early days of the Libyan revolution, I asked Chris to be our envoy to the rebel opposition.
He arrived on a cargo ship in the port of Benghazi and began building our relationships with
Libya's revolutionaries. He risked his life to stop a tyrant, then gave his life trying to help build a
better Libya. The world needs more Chris Stevenses. I spoke with his sister, Ann, this morning,
and told her that he will be remembered as a hero by many nations.

Sean Smith was an Air Force veteran. He spent 10 years as an information management officer
in the State Department, he was posted at The Hague, and was in Libya on a brief temporary
assignment. He was a husband to his wife Heather, with whom I spoke this morning. He was a
father to two young children, Samantha and Nathan. They will grow up being proud of the
service their father gave to our country, service that took him from Pretoria to Baghdad, and
finally to Benghazi.
The mission that drew Chris and Sean and their colleagues to Libya is both noble and necessary,
and we and the people of Libya honor their memory by carrying it forward. This is not easy.
Today, many Americans are asking -- indeed, I asked myself how could this happen? How
could this happen in a country we helped liberate, in a city we helped save from destruction?
This question reflects just how complicated and, at times, how confounding the world can be.
But we must be clear-eyed, even in our grief. This was an attack by a small and savage group â€”
not the people or Government of Libya. Everywhere Chris and his team went in Libya, in a
country scarred by war and tyranny, they were hailed as friends and partners. And when the
attack came yesterday, Libyans stood and fought to defend our post. Some were wounded.
Libyans carried Chris' body to the hospital, and they helped rescue and lead other Americans to
safety. And last night, when I spoke with the President of Libya, he strongly condemned the
violence and pledged every effort to protect our people and pursue those responsible.
The friendship between our countries, borne out of shared struggle, will not be another casualty
of this attack. A free and stable Libya is still in America's interest and security, and we will not
turn our back on that, nor will we rest until those responsible for these attacks are found and
brought to justice. We are working closely with the Libyan authorities to move swiftly and
surely. We are also working with partners around the world to safeguard other American
embassies, consulates, and citizens.
There will be more time later to reflect, but today, we have work to do. There is no higher
priority than protecting our men and women wherever they serve. We are working to determine
the precise motivations and methods of those who carried out this assault. Some have sought to
justify this vicious behavior, along with the protest that took place at our Embassy in Cairo
yesterday, as a response to inflammatory material posted on the intemet. America's commitment
to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear â€” there is
no justification for this, none. Violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith. And as long
as there are those who would take innocent life in the name of God, the world will never know a
true and lasting peace.
It is especially difficult that this happened on September 1 1th It's an anniversary that means a
great deal to all Americans. Every year on that day, we are reminded that our work is not yet
finished, that the job of putting an end to violent extremism and building a safe and stable world
continues. But September 11th means even more than that. it is a day on which we remember

Statement on the Deaths of Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty in Benghazi, Libya
September 13, 2012
The attack on our diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya on Tuesday claimed the lives of four
Americans. Yesterday, I spoke about two: Ambassador Chris Stevens and Information
Management Officer Sean Smith. Today, we also recognize the two security personnel who died
helping protect their colleagues. Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty were both decorated
military veterans who served our country with honor and distinction. Our thoughts, prayers, and
deepest gratitude are with their families and friends. Our embassies could not carry on our
critical work around the world without the service and sacrifice of brave people like Tyrone and
Glen.
Tyrone's friends and colleagues called him ""Rone,"" and they relied on his courage and skill,
honed over two decades as a Navy SEAL. In uniform, he served multiple tours in Iraq and
Afghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in dangerous posts from
Central America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well as the arm of a warrior,
earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. All our hearts go out to
Tyrone's wife Dorothy and his three sons, Tyrone Jr., Hunter, and Kai, who was born just a few
months ago.
We also grieve for Glen Doherty, called Bub, and his family: his father Bernard, his mother
Barbara, his brother Gregory, and his sister Kathleen. Glen was also a former Navy SEAL and an
experienced paramedic. And he put his life on the line many times, protecting Americans in Iraq,
Afghanistan, and other hotspots. In the end, he died the way he lived â€” with selfless honor and
unstinting valor.
We condemn the attack that took the lives of these heroes in the strongest terms, and we are
taking additional steps to safeguard American embassies, consulates, and citizens around the
world. This violence should shock the conscience of people of all faiths and traditions. We
appreciate the statements of support that have poured in from across the region and beyond.

People of conscience and goodwill everywhere must stand together in these difficult days against
violence, hate, and division.
I am enormously proud of the men and women who risk their lives every day in the service of
our country and our values. They help make the United States the greatest force for peace,
progress, and human dignity that the world has ever known. We honor the memory of our fallen
colleagues by continuing their work and carrying on the best traditions of a bold and generous
nation.
Remarks at theOpening Plenary of the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue
September 13, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good morning. Well, let me welcome our friends and colleagues
from Morocco here to the Benjamin Franklin Room on the eighth floor of the State Department
for this very important first session of the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue. Before I begin to
address the significance of this Strategic Dialogue and the next step in our long relations with
Morocco, I want to say a few words about the events unfolding in the world today.
We are closely watching what is happening in Yemen and elsewhere, and we certainly hope and
expect that there will be steps taken to avoid violence and prevent the escalation of protests into
violence.
I also want to take a moment to address the video circulating on the Internet that has led to these
protests in a number of countries. Let me state very clearly and I hope it is obvious -- that the
United States Government had absolutely nothing to do with this video. We absolutely reject its
content and message. America's commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very
beginning of our nation. And as you know, we are home to people of all religions, many of
whom came to this country seeking the right to exercise their own religion, including, of course,
millions of Muslims. And we have the greatest respect for people of faith.
To us, to me personally, this video is disgusting and reprehensible. It appears to have a deeply
cynical purpose: to denigrate a great religion and to provoke rage. But as I said yesterday, there
is no justification, none at all, for responding to this video with violence. We condemn the
violence that has resulted in the strongest terms, and we greatly appreciate that many Muslims in
the United States and around the world have spoken out on this issue.
Violence, we believe, has no place in religion and is no way to honor religion. Islam, like other
religions, respects the fundamental dignity of human beings, and it is a violation of that
fundamental dignity to wage attacks on innocents. As long as there are those who are willing to
shed blood and take innocent life in the name of religion, the name of God, the world will never
know a true and lasting peace. It is especially wrong for violence to be directed against
diplomatic missions, These are places whose very purpose is peaceful: to promote better
understanding across countries and cultures. All governments have a responsibility to protect

those spaces and people, because to attack an embassy is to attack the idea that we can work
together to build understanding and a better future.
Now, I know it is hard for some people to understand why the United States cannot or does not
just prevent these kinds of reprehensible videos from ever seeing the light of day. Now, I would
note that in today's world with today's technologies, that is impossible. But even if it were
possible, our country does have a long tradition of free expression which is enshrined in our
Constitution and our law, and we do not stop individual citizens from expressing their views no
matter how distasteful they may be.
There are, of course, different views around the world about the outer limits of free speech and
free expression, but there should be no debate about the simple proposition that violence in
response to speech is not acceptable. We all â€” whether we are leaders in government, leaders in
civil society or religious leaders â€” must draw the line at violence. And any responsible leader
should be standing up now and drawing that line.
I wanted to begin with this statement, because, as our Moroccan friends and all of you know, this
has been a difficult week at the State Department. I very much appreciate, Minister, the
condolences your government expressed to our Embassy in Rabat. And even though that tragedy
happened far away in Benghazi, we found a reminder of the deep bounds that connect Morocco
to the United States. It was in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco that one of the Americans
we lost this week, Ambassador Chris Stevens, fell in love with the region when he served as a
Peace Corps volunteer there. That experience set him on a decades-long career of service. So in
the memory of fallen friends and colleagues, let us remind ourselves of the many ways in which
not just our governments but the people of our two nations have worked together to build a better
future.
In many ways, the United States looks to Morocco to be a leader and a model. His Majesty King
Mohammed deserves great credit for the work you've undertaken. In fact, after my visit to Rabat
earlier this year, I told my team: ""We need to start a Strategic Dialogue with Morocco."" No
country has been a friend of the United States longer than Morocco. You were the first nation to
recognize us back in 1777. But we're not satisfied with simply having a friendship that is
longstanding. We want one that is dynamic, growing, looking toward the future. So let me
highlight a few of the areas we should focus on today.
On political reform, we have all seen remarkable changes taking place across North Africa and
the Middle East. I commend Morocco and your government for your efforts to stay ahead of
these changes by holding free and fair elections, empowering the elected parliament, taking other
steps to ensure that the government reflects the will of the people. Today, our political working
group will discuss how the United States can continue to support your efforts to translate
commitments into actions. Because as we all know, democracy, real reform, require that people
themselves feel the changes in their everyday lives: the courts reformed, the goverment more

open and transparent, universal human rights of all Moroccans -- men and women alike â€”
respected.
I'm especially pleased by Morocco's commitments to take on the deeply troubling problem of
child marriage. We know that child brides are less likely to get an education, more likely to face
life-threatening problems, particularly around child birth and delivery, which not only
shortchanges them but can even rob them and their communities of their lives and talents. So we
want to encourage the government and civil society to continue their important work together on
this issue.
With regard to the Western Sahara, the United States continues to support efforts to find a
peaceful, sustainable, mutually agreed-upon solution. U.S. policy toward the Western Sahara has
remained consistent for many years. We have made clear that Morocco's autonomy plan is
serious, realistic, and credible, and that it represents a potential approach that could satisfy the
aspirations of the people in the Western Sahara to run their own affairs in peace and dignity. We
continue to support the negotiations carried out by the United Nations and hope parties can work
toward resolution.
With respect to the economy, our second working group will focus on what more can be done to
deliver tangible economic benefits. Morocco's economy is relatively healthy, but you face the
same problem that is now endemic across the world â€” unemployment is still too high, especially
among young people.
That's why the United States is providing $1.5 million to support an effart to attract foreign
investors, foster local economic development, and combat corruption across the region. And I'm
pleased to announce that later this year we will hold a Morocco business development
conference here in Washington to connect businesses from both countries.
'Today, we should discuss ways to build on all of these efforts by increasing bilateral trade, a
particular goal of mine since so much trade from Morocco goes to Europe. I'd like to increase
the amount of trade coming to the United States, and also to improve economic integration
across North Africa, which could greatly benefit Morocco because of Morocco's stability and
Morocco's very strong economic foundation. The greater integration there is, the greater the
benefits for Moroccans.
Third, the attack in Benghazi this week reminds us that security remains a vital issue. Through
our work together on the Global Counterterrorism Task Force, the United States and Morocco
already share crucial information and best practices, and I thank Morocco for hosting a Global
Counterterrorism Task Force workshop on threats in the South Atlantic next month.

We are also collaborating through USAID, the Peace Corps, and other agencies to help provide
Moroccan youth with alternatives to criminal and extremist organizations. And so we are
partnering to help strengthen Morocco's criminal justice system and law enforcement.
There will be a lot to discuss in the meeting today. And let me add, the United States greatly
appreciates the constructive role Morocco is playing on the UN Security Council, especially your
support for the effort to end the violence and bloodshed in Syria and help to usher in a new
democratic future for that country. I commend Morocco for offering to host the next ministerial
meeting of the Friends of the Syrian People, and we look forward to continuing to work closely
together as close partners even after your term on the Security Council has ended.
Finally, our education and cultural ties are reason for much celebration. This year marks the 30th
anniversary of our official program to facilitate academic exchanges and other bonds between us.
There are more than 5,000 Moroccan alumni of these. programs. Two are with us today â€” Dr.
Benjciloun and Dr. Ouaouicha â€” and we thank them. But among all our work on this front from
preserving Morocco's historic sites to empowering youth, there's one area I particularly hope we
can focus on today and receive your advice and counsel â€” munely, interfaith dialogue.
In these tense and turbulent times, its more important than ever for people of different faiths to
exchange ideas, to build understanding, to promote religious tolerance. It's one of the great
challenges of the 21 century, and it's one that we must address together.
So we have a lot of work to do, Minister, but our friendship runs long and deep, and as the treaty
our nations signed in 1786 says. and I quote, ""Trusting in God, it will remain permanent."" I'm
confident that we will continue to solve problems and produce results that make our nations
stronger more peaceful, more secure, more prosperous, and also contribute to doing the same Rif
the world.
So again, let me welcome you, Minister. Ifs been a great pleasure for me to get to know you, to
work with you, to be your colleague bilaterally, regionally, and globally, and also welcome your
distinguished delegation.
Thank you. (Applause.)
Remarks at Reception Marking Eid

Tonight, our gathering is more somber than any of us would like. This comes during sad and
difficult days for the State Department family, We lost four Americans, They were good and
brave men, They were committed to the cause of building a brighter future for the people of
Libya. And we condemn the violence in the strongest terms, the violence against our posts in
Benghazi, in Egypt, and now in Yemen.
The Libyan ambassador is with us tonight, and I want to take a moment to thank him for the
support that his government and the Libyan people have shown to the United States in this
tragedy, particularly the outpouring of feelings of grief and loss because of the killing of our
ambassador.
Ambassador Aujali, would you mind saying a few words?
AMBASSADOR AUJALI: [redacted}
SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Ambassador. I know that that was a very
personal loss for you, as it was for me. I'm the one who sent Chris to Benghazi during the
revolution to show support and be able to advise our government about what we could do to
bring freedom and democracy and opportunity to the people of Libya.
Religious freedom and religious tolerance are essential to the stability of any nation, any people.
Hatred and violence in the name of religion only poison the well. All people of faith and good
will know that the actions of a small and savage group in Benghazi do not honor religion or God
in any way. Nor do they speak for the more than one billion Muslims around the world, many of
whom have shown an outpouring of support during this time.
Unfortunately, however, over the last 24 hours, we have also seen violence spread elsewhere.
Some seek to justify this behavior as a response to inflammatory, despicable material posted on
the internet. As I said earlier today, the United States rejects both the content and the message of
that video. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of
others. At our meeting earlier today, my colleague, the foreign minister of Morocco, said that all
prophets should be respected because they are all symbols of our humanity, for all humanity,
But both of us were crystal clear in this paramount message: There is never any justification for
violent acts of this kind. And we look to leaders around the world to stand up and speak out
against violence, and to take steps to protect diplomatic missions from attack.
Think about it. When Christians are subject to insults to their faith, and that certainly happens,
we expect them not to resort to violence. When Hindus or Buddhists are subjected to insults to
their faiths and that also certainly happens, we expect them not to resort to violence. The same
goes for all faiths, including Islam.

When all of us who are people of faith â€” and I am one â€” feel the pain of insults, of
misunderstanding, of denigration to what we cherish, we must expect ourselves and others not to
resort to violence. That is a universal standard and expectation, and it is everyone's obligation to
meet that, so that we make no differences, we expect no less of ourselves than we expect of
others. You cannot respond to offensive speech with violence without begetting more violence.
And I so strongly believe that the great religions of the world are stronger than any insults. They
have withstood offense for centuries. Refraining from violence, then, is not a sign of weakness in
one's faith; it is absolutely the opposite, a sign that one's faith is unshakable.
So tonight, we must come together and recommit ourselves to working toward a future marked
by understanding and acceptance rather than distrust, hatred, and fear. We can pledge that
whenever one person speaks out in ignorance and bigotry, ten voices will answer. They will
answer resoundingly against the offense and the insult, answering ignorance with enlightenment,
answering hatred with understanding, answering darkness with light; that if one person commits
a violent act in the name of religion, millions will stand up and condemn it out of strength.
In times like these, it can be easy to despair that some differences are irreconcilable, some

As we work tosecure our personnel and facilities, we have confirmed that one of our State Department officerswas killed. We are heartbroken by this terrible loss. Our thoughts and prayers are with his familyand those who have suffered in this attack.This evening, I called Libyan President Magariaf to coordinate additional support to protectAmericans in Libya. President Magariaf expressed his condemnation and condolences andpledged his government's full cooperation.Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material postedon the Internet The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefsof others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation.But let me be clear: There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.In light of the events of today, the United States government is working with partner countriesaround the world to protect our personnel, our missions, and American citizens worldwide.Statement on the Death of American Personnel in Benghazi, LibyaSeptember 12, 2012It is with profound sadness that I share the news of the death of four American personnel inBenghazi, Libya yesterday. Among them were United States Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevensand Foreign Service Information Management Officer, Sean Smith. We are still making next ofkin notifications for the other two individuals. Our hearts go out to all their families andcolleagues.A 21 year veteran of the Foreign Service, Ambassador Stevens died last night from injuries hesustained in the attack on our office in Benghazi.I had the privilege of swearing in Chris for his post in Libya only a few months ago. He spokeeloquently about his passion for service, for diplomacy and for the Libyan people. Thisassignment was only the latest in his more than two decades of dedication to advancing closerties with the people of the Middle East and North Africa which began as a Peace CorpsVolunteer in Morocco. As the conflict in Libya unfolded, Chris was one of the first Americanson the ground in Benghazi. He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand tobuild the foundation for a new, free nation. He spent every day since helping to finish the workthat he started. Chris was committed to advancing America's values and interests, even whenthat meant putting himself in danger.Sean Smith was a husband and a father of two, who joined the Department ten years ago.

Heavily armed militantsassaulted the compound and set fire to our buildings. American and Libyan security personnelbattled the attackers together. Four Americans were killed. They included Sean Smith, a ForeignService information management officer, and our Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. We arestill making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals.This is an attack that should shock the conscience of people of all faiths around the world. Wecondemn in the strongest terms this senseless act of violence, and we send our prayers to thefamilies, friends, and colleagues of those we've lost.All over the world, every day, America's diplomats and development experts risk their lives inthe service of our country and our values, because they believe that the United States must be aforce for peace and progress in the world, that these aspirations are worth striving and sacrificingfor. Alongside our men and women in uniform, they represent the best traditions of a bold andgenerous nation.In the lobby of this building, the State Department, the names of those vvho have fallen in the lineof duty are inscribed in marble. Our hearts break over each one. And now, because of thistragedy, we have new heroes to honor and more friends to mourn.Chris Stevens fell in love with the Middle East as a young Peace Corps volunteer teachingEnglish in Morocco. He joined the Foreign Service, learned languages, won friends for Americain distant places, and made other people's hopes his own.In the early days of the Libyan revolution, I asked Chris to be our envoy to the rebel opposition.He arrived on a cargo ship in the port of Benghazi and began building our relationships withLibya's revolutionaries. He risked his life to stop a tyrant, then gave his life trying to help build abetter Libya. The world needs more Chris Stevenses.

NO FOIA WAIVER.Sean Smith was an Air Force veteran. He spent 10 years as an information management officerin the State Department, he was posted at The Hague, and was in Libya on a brief temporaryassignment. He was a husband to his wife Heather, with whom I spoke this morning. He was afather to two young children, Samantha and Nathan. They will grow up being proud of theservice their father gave to our country, service that took him from Pretoria to Baghdad, andfinally to Benghazi.The mission that drew Chris and Sean and their colleagues to Libya is both noble and necessary,and we and the people of Libya honor their memory by carrying it forward. This is not easy.Today, many Americans are asking -- indeed, I asked myself how could this happen? Howcould this happen in a country we helped liberate, in a city we helped save from destruction?This question reflects just how complicated and, at times, how confounding the world can be.But we must be clear-eyed, even in our grief. This was an attack by a small and savage group â€”not the people or Government of Libya. Everywhere Chris and his team went in Libya, in acountry scarred by war and tyranny, they were hailed as friends and partners. And when theattack came yesterday, Libyans stood and fought to defend our post. Some were wounded.Libyans carried Chris' body to the hospital, and they helped rescue and lead other Americans tosafety. And last night, when I spoke with the President of Libya, he strongly condemned theviolence and pledged every effort to protect our people and pursue those responsible.The friendship between our countries, borne out of shared struggle, will not be another casualtyof this attack. A free and stable Libya is still in America's interest and security, and we will notturn our back on that, nor will we rest until those responsible for these attacks are found andbrought to justice. We are working closely with the Libyan authorities to move swiftly andsurely. We are also working with partners around the world to safeguard other Americanembassies, consulates, and citizens.There will be more time later to reflect, but today, we have work to do. There is no higherpriority than protecting our men and women wherever they serve. We are working to determinethe precise motivations and methods of those who carried out this assault. Some have sought tojustify this vicious behavior, along with the protest that took place at our Embassy in Cairoyesterday, as a response to inflammatory material posted on the intemet. America's commitmentto religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear â€” there isno justification for this, none. Violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith. And as longas there are those who would take innocent life in the name of God, the world will never know atrue and lasting peace.It is especially difficult that this happened on September 1 1th It's an anniversary that means agreat deal to all Americans.

Doherty in Benghazi, LibyaSeptember 13, 2012The attack on our diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya on Tuesday claimed the lives of fourAmericans. Yesterday, I spoke about two: Ambassador Chris Stevens and InformationManagement Officer Sean Smith. Today, we also recognize the two security personnel who diedhelping protect their colleagues. Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty were both decoratedmilitary veterans who served our country with honor and distinction. Our thoughts, prayers, anddeepest gratitude are with their families and friends. Our embassies could not carry on ourcritical work around the world without the service and sacrifice of brave people like Tyrone andGlen.Tyrone's friends and colleagues called him ""Rone,"" and they relied on his courage and skill,honed over two decades as a Navy SEAL. In uniform, he served multiple tours in Iraq andAfghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in dangerous posts fromCentral America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well as the arm of a warrior,earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. All our hearts go out toTyrone's wife Dorothy and his three sons, Tyrone Jr., Hunter, and Kai, who was born just a fewmonths ago.We also grieve for Glen Doherty, called Bub, and his family: his father Bernard, his motherBarbara, his brother Gregory, and his sister Kathleen. Glen was also a former Navy SEAL and anexperienced paramedic. And he put his life on the line many times, protecting Americans in Iraq,Afghanistan, and other hotspots. In the end, he died the way he lived â€” with selfless honor andunstinting valor.We condemn the attack that took the lives of these heroes in the strongest terms, and we aretaking additional steps to safeguard American embassies, consulates, and citizens around theworld. This violence should shock the conscience of people of all faiths and traditions. Weappreciate the statements of support that have poured in from across the region and beyond.UNCLASSIFIEDU.S. Department of StateCase No. F-2015-04841Doc No. C05739610Date: 05/13/2015STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Well, let me welcome our friends and colleaguesfrom Morocco here to the Benjamin Franklin Room on the eighth floor of the State Departmentfor this very important first session of the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue. Before I begin toaddress the significance of this Strategic Dialogue and the next step in our long relations withMorocco, I want to say a few words about the events unfolding in the world today.We are closely watching what is happening in Yemen and elsewhere, and we certainly hope andexpect that there will be steps taken to avoid violence and prevent the escalation of protests intoviolence.I also want to take a moment to address the video circulating on the Internet that has led to theseprotests in a number of countries. Let me state very clearly and I hope it is obvious -- that theUnited States Government had absolutely nothing to do with this video. We absolutely reject itscontent and message. America's commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the verybeginning of our nation. And as you know, we are home to people of all religions, many ofwhom came to this country seeking the right to exercise their own religion, including, of course,millions of Muslims. And we have the greatest respect for people of faith.To us, to me personally, this video is disgusting and reprehensible. It appears to have a deeplycynical purpose: to denigrate a great religion and to provoke rage. But as I said yesterday, thereis no justification, none at all, for responding to this video with violence. We condemn theviolence that has resulted in the strongest terms, and we greatly appreciate that many Muslims inthe United States and around the world have spoken out on this issue.Violence, we believe, has no place in religion and is no way to honor religion. Islam, like otherreligions, respects the fundamental dignity of human beings, and it is a violation of thatfundamental dignity to wage attacks on innocents. As long as there are those who are willing toshed blood and take innocent life in the name of religion, the name of God, the world will neverknow a true and lasting peace. It is especially wrong for violence to be directed againstdiplomatic missions, These are places whose very purpose is peaceful: to promote betterunderstanding across countries and cultures. All governments have a responsibility to protectUNCLASSIFIEDU.S. Department of StateCase No. F-2015-04841Doc No. C05739610Date: 05/13/2015STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Now, I wouldnote that in today's world with today's technologies, that is impossible. But even if it werepossible, our country does have a long tradition of free expression which is enshrined in ourConstitution and our law, and we do not stop individual citizens from expressing their views nomatter how distasteful they may be.There are, of course, different views around the world about the outer limits of free speech andfree expression, but there should be no debate about the simple proposition that violence inresponse to speech is not acceptable. We all â€” whether we are leaders in government, leaders incivil society or religious leaders â€” must draw the line at violence. And any responsible leadershould be standing up now and drawing that line.I wanted to begin with this statement, because, as our Moroccan friends and all of you know, thishas been a difficult week at the State Department. I very much appreciate, Minister, thecondolences your government expressed to our Embassy in Rabat. And even though that tragedyhappened far away in Benghazi, we found a reminder of the deep bounds that connect Moroccoto the United States. It was in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco that one of the Americanswe lost this week, Ambassador Chris Stevens, fell in love with the region when he served as aPeace Corps volunteer there. That experience set him on a decades-long career of service. So inthe memory of fallen friends and colleagues, let us remind ourselves of the many ways in whichnot just our governments but the people of our two nations have worked together to build a betterfuture.In many ways, the United States looks to Morocco to be a leader and a model. His Majesty KingMohammed deserves great credit for the work you've undertaken. In fact, after my visit to Rabatearlier this year, I told my team: ""We need to start a Strategic Dialogue with Morocco."" Nocountry has been a friend of the United States longer than Morocco. You were the first nation torecognize us back in 1777. But we're not satisfied with simply having a friendship that islongstanding. We want one that is dynamic, growing, looking toward the future. So let mehighlight a few of the areas we should focus on today.On political reform, we have all seen remarkable changes taking place across North Africa andthe Middle East. I commend Morocco and your government for your efforts to stay ahead ofthese changes by holding free and fair elections, empowering the elected parliament, taking othersteps to ensure that the government reflects the will of the people. Today, our political workinggroup will discuss how the United States can continue to support your efforts to translatecommitments into actions. Because as we all know, democracy, real reform, require that peoplethemselves feel the changes in their everyday lives: the courts reformed, the goverment moreUNCLASSIFIEDU.S. Department of StateCase No. F-2015-04841Doc No. C05739610Date: 05/13/2015STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

We know that child brides are less likely to get an education, more likely to facelife-threatening problems, particularly around child birth and delivery, which not onlyshortchanges them but can even rob them and their communities of their lives and talents. So wewant to encourage the government and civil society to continue their important work together onthis issue.With regard to the Western Sahara, the United States continues to support efforts to find apeaceful, sustainable, mutually agreed-upon solution. U.S. policy toward the Western Sahara hasremained consistent for many years. We have made clear that Morocco's autonomy plan isserious, realistic, and credible, and that it represents a potential approach that could satisfy theaspirations of the people in the Western Sahara to run their own affairs in peace and dignity. Wecontinue to support the negotiations carried out by the United Nations and hope parties can worktoward resolution.With respect to the economy, our second working group will focus on what more can be done todeliver tangible economic benefits. Morocco's economy is relatively healthy, but you face thesame problem that is now endemic across the world â€” unemployment is still too high, especiallyamong young people.That's why the United States is providing $1.5 million to support an effart to attract foreigninvestors, foster local economic development, and combat corruption across the region. And I'mpleased to announce that later this year we will hold a Morocco business developmentconference here in Washington to connect businesses from both countries.'Today, we should discuss ways to build on all of these efforts by increasing bilateral trade, aparticular goal of mine since so much trade from Morocco goes to Europe. I'd like to increasethe amount of trade coming to the United States, and also to improve economic integrationacross North Africa, which could greatly benefit Morocco because of Morocco's stability andMorocco's very strong economic foundation. The greater integration there is, the greater thebenefits for Moroccans.Third, the attack in Benghazi this week reminds us that security remains a vital issue. Throughour work together on the Global Counterterrorism Task Force, the United States and Moroccoalready share crucial information and best practices, and I thank Morocco for hosting a GlobalCounterterrorism Task Force workshop on threats in the South Atlantic next month.UNCLASSIFIEDU.S. Department of StateCase No. F-2015-04841Doc No. C05739610Date: 05/13/2015STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

And let me add, the United States greatlyappreciates the constructive role Morocco is playing on the UN Security Council, especially yoursupport for the effort to end the violence and bloodshed in Syria and help to usher in a newdemocratic future for that country. I commend Morocco for offering to host the next ministerialmeeting of the Friends of the Syrian People, and we look forward to continuing to work closelytogether as close partners even after your term on the Security Council has ended.Finally, our education and cultural ties are reason for much celebration. This year marks the 30thanniversary of our official program to facilitate academic exchanges and other bonds between us.There are more than 5,000 Moroccan alumni of these. programs. Two are with us today â€” Dr.Benjciloun and Dr. Ouaouicha â€” and we thank them. But among all our work on this front frompreserving Morocco's historic sites to empowering youth, there's one area I particularly hope wecan focus on today and receive your advice and counsel â€” munely, interfaith dialogue.In these tense and turbulent times, its more important than ever for people of different faiths toexchange ideas, to build understanding, to promote religious tolerance. It's one of the greatchallenges of the 21 century, and it's one that we must address together.So we have a lot of work to do, Minister, but our friendship runs long and deep, and as the treatyour nations signed in 1786 says. and I quote, ""Trusting in God, it will remain permanent."" I'mconfident that we will continue to solve problems and produce results that make our nationsstronger more peaceful, more secure, more prosperous, and also contribute to doing the same Rifthe world.So again, let me welcome you, Minister.

This comes during sad anddifficult days for the State Department family, We lost four Americans, They were good andbrave men, They were committed to the cause of building a brighter future for the people ofLibya. And we condemn the violence in the strongest terms, the violence against our posts inBenghazi, in Egypt, and now in Yemen.The Libyan ambassador is with us tonight, and I want to take a moment to thank him for thesupport that his government and the Libyan people have shown to the United States in thistragedy, particularly the outpouring of feelings of grief and loss because of the killing of ourambassador.Ambassador Aujali, would you mind saying a few words?AMBASSADOR AUJALI: [redacted}SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Ambassador. I know that that was a verypersonal loss for you, as it was for me. I'm the one who sent Chris to Benghazi during therevolution to show support and be able to advise our government about what we could do tobring freedom and democracy and opportunity to the people of Libya.Religious freedom and religious tolerance are essential to the stability of any nation, any people.Hatred and violence in the name of religion only poison the well. All people of faith and goodwill know that the actions of a small and savage group in Benghazi do not honor religion or Godin any way. Nor do they speak for the more than one billion Muslims around the world, many ofwhom have shown an outpouring of support during this time.Unfortunately, however, over the last 24 hours, we have also seen violence spread elsewhere.Some seek to justify this behavior as a response to inflammatory, despicable material posted onthe internet. As I said earlier today, the United States rejects both the content and the message ofthat video. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs ofothers. At our meeting earlier today, my colleague, the foreign minister of Morocco, said that allprophets should be respected because they are all symbols of our humanity, for all humanity,But both of us were crystal clear in this paramount message: There is never any justification forviolent acts of this kind. And we look to leaders around the world to stand up and speak outagainst violence, and to take steps to protect diplomatic missions from attack.Think about it. When Christians are subject to insults to their faith, and that certainly happens,we expect them not to resort to violence. When Hindus or Buddhists are subjected to insults totheir faiths and that also certainly happens, we expect them not to resort to violence. The samegoes for all faiths, including Islam.UNCLASSIFIEDU.S. Department of StateCase No. F-2015-04841Doc No. C05739610Date: 05/13/2015STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.When all of us who are people of faith â€” and I am one â€” feel the pain of insults, ofmisunderstanding, of denigration to what we cherish, we must expect ourselves and others not toresort to violence. That is a universal standard and expectation, and it is everyone's obligation tomeet that, so that we make no differences, we expect no less of ourselves than we expect ofothers. You cannot respond to offensive speech with violence without begetting more violence.And I so strongly believe that the great religions of the world are stronger than any insults. Theyhave withstood offense for centuries. Refraining from violence, then, is not a sign of weakness inone's faith; it is absolutely the opposite, a sign that one's faith is unshakable.So tonight, we must come together and recommit ourselves to working toward a future markedby understanding and acceptance rather than distrust, hatred, and fear. We can pledge thatwhenever one person speaks out in ignorance and bigotry, ten voices will answer. They willanswer resoundingly against the offense and the insult, answering ignorance with enlightenment,answering hatred with understanding, answering darkness with light; that if one person commitsa violent act in the name of religion, millions will stand up and condemn it out of strength.In times like these, it can be easy to despair that some differences are irreconcilable, somemountains too steep to climb; we will therefore never reach the level of understanding andpeacefulness that we seek, and which",,,,

doing to help shape that better future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Two years ago in this room, at our Eid reception, we launched a program called Generation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Change to lead a grassroots agenda of positive engagement with Muslim communities. And I,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
asked the young Muslim leaders in the audience that night to be our unofficial ambassadors, to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
help build personal connections, seek out partners in other countries. And I can report to you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tonight they did not disappoint. In a few minutes, you're going to meet some of these young,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
leaders, each with a powerful story to tell.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Generation Change network that started in this room now circles the globe. We are building,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
an international alliance of young people who want to drive change in their own communities.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They act as mentors, spark respectful debates, simply offer words of encouragement when,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
needed. But most importantly, they inspire others to keep expanding the circle of mutual,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
understanding and respect, one person at a time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even as we work to spread tolerance more broadly, we also are working to deepen our,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
appreciation for the experiences of others. Our 2012 Hours Against Hate initiative encourages,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
young people to put themselves in another person's shoes through service projects. So far, young,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
people from all over the world have pledged thousands of volunteer hours to help people from a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
different background, to see them as a fellow human being, not a stereotype, not a caricature, but,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
another real live person â€” people who don't look like you, live like you, pray like you, but with,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whom we will share this planet. And therefore, we have work to do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
People of faith and conscience are called to be the leaders of tolerance. In my tradition, like all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
traditions, we are expected to love one another. And together, we have to translate that into better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
understanding and cooperation. I'm particularly pleased that the young people you will hear from,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tonight are really setting an example, not only for young people elsewhere in the world but,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
frankly, for us who are older as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Let me now call to the stage someone who has been a tremendous assistance to me in these,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
efforts. Farah Pandith is the Department's first Special Representative to Muslim Communities.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And from the beginning, she has made reaching out to young people and civil society her top,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
priority. Farah will introduce you to three young leaders who I am very proud of.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Remarks at the Transfer of Remains Ceremony to Honor Those Lost in Attacks in Benghazi, Libya,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Chaplain. Mr. President, Mr. Vice President,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Secretary Panetta, Ambassador Rice, Secretary Powell and Mrs. Powell, family members of the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
four patriots and heroes we bring home, members of the State Department family, ladies and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gentlemen, today we bring home four Americans who gave their lives for our country and our,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
values. To the families of our fallen colleagues, I offer our most heartfelt condolences and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
deepest gratitude.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sean Smith joined the State Department after six years in the Air Force. He was respected as an,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
expert on technology by colleagues in Pretoria, Baghdad, Montreal, and The Hague. He enrolled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in correspondence courses at Penn State and had high hopes for the future. Sean leaves behind a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
loving wife Heather, two young children, Samantha and Nathan, and scores of grieving family,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
friends, and colleagues. And that's just in this world. Because online in the virtual worlds that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sean helped create, he is also being mourned by countless competitors, collaborators, and garners,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
who shared his passion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tyrone Woods, known to most as Rone, spent two decades as a Navy SEAL, serving multiple,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dangerous posts from Central America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as the arms of a warrior, earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. Our,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hearts go out to Tyrone's wife Dorothy, and his three sons Tyrone, Jr., Hunter, and Kai, born just,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a few months ago, along with his grieving family, friends, and colleagues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Glen Doherty, who went by Bub, was also a former SEAL and an experienced paramedic. He too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
died as he lived, serving his country and protecting his colleagues. Glen deployed to some of the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most dangerous places on Earth, including Iraq and Afghanistan, always putting his life on the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
line to safeguard other Americans. Our thoughts and prayers are with Glen's father Bernard, his,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mother Barbara, his brother Gregory, his sister Kathleen, and their grieving families, friends, and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
colleagues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was honored to know Ambassador Chris Stevens. I want to thank his parents and siblings, who,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are here today, for sharing Chris with us and with our country. What a wonderful gift you gave,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
us. Over his distinguished career in the Foreign Service, Chris won friends for the United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in far-flung places. He made those people's hopes his own. During the revolution in Libya, he,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
risked his life to help protect the Libyan people from a tyrant, and he gave his life helping them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
build a better cowl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
People loved to work with Chris. And as he rose through the ranks, they loved to work for Chris.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He was known not only for his courage but for his smile â€” goofy but contagious â€” for his sense,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of fun and that California cool.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In the days since the attack, so many Libyans â€” including the Ambassador from Libya to the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
United States, who is with us today â€” have expressed their sorrow and solidarity. One young,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
woman, her head covered and her eyes haunted with sadness, held up a handwritten sign that said,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thugs and killers don't represent Benghazi nor Islam."""" The President of the Palestinian",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Authority, who worked closely with Chris when he served in Jerusalem, sent me a letter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
remembering his energy and integrity," and deploring â€” and I quote â€” """"an act of ugly terror.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Many others from across the Middle East and North Africa have offered similar sentiments.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We've seen the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
heavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We've seen rage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and violence directed at American embassies over an awful internet video that we had nothing to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do with. It is hard for the American people to make sense of that because. it is senseless, and it is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
totally unacceptable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The people of Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Tunisia did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tyranny of a mob. Reasonable people and responsible leaders in these countries need to do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everything they can to restore security and hold accountable those behind these violent acts. And,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we will, under the President's leadership, keep taking steps to protect our personnel around the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
world.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There will be more difficult days ahead, but it is important that we don't lose sight of the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fundamental fact-that America must keep leading the world. We owe it to those four men to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
continue the long, hard work of diplomacy. I am enormously proud of the men and women of the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
State Department. I'm proud of all those across our government, civilian and military alike, who,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Remarks With Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations Patricia Espinosa After Their,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Meeting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18-Sep,2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it is such a pleasure for me to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
welcome my friend and colleague, Secretary Espinosa, along with a very distinguished,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
delegation of officials from the Mexican Government for this continuation of consultation at the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
highest levels of each of our governments.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Before I turn to the matters discussed today, let me give a brief update on the ongoing U.S.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
response to the protests in the Middle East and elsewhere. I'm sure as you know already, we are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
taking aggressive steps to protect our staffs in embassies and consulates worldwide. That,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
includes reviewing our security posture at every post and augmenting it where necessary. And,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we are working closely with the Libyan Government in our efforts to bring to justice those who,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
murdered our four American colleagues in Benghazi.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The FBI is now in Tripoli to join the investigation with Libyan officials, and there is nothing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
more important to us than ensuring the safety of our American representatives worldwide. At the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same time, as I have said to State Department employees, the incidents of the past week highlight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how important our work is. The United States must and will remain strongly engaged in the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
world. Our men and women risk their lives in service to our country and our values, because they,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
know that the United States must be a force for peace and progress. That is worth striving and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sacrificing for, and nothing that happened last week changes this fundamental fact.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now, turning to our friends and partners in Mexico, we are always pleased to have a chance to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
discuss matters of mutual interest and concern between us. Mexico is one of our closest friends,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as well as partner on dozens of critical issues. So we talk about every kind of issue you can,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
imagine, from education and healthcare to poverty alleviation to the environment. But today, we,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
focused on a top priority for us both â€” security.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We just co-chaired the fourth meeting of the U.S.-Mexico Merida High-Level Consultative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Group. This is the last one we will hold during the Calderon Administration. And I want to offer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my personal appreciation to President Calderon and to Foreign Secretary Espinosa for their,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
leadership and commitment to this partnership and to all on both sides of the border in our,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
governments who have been deeply engaged and committed to it. The Merida Initiative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
represents an unprecedented level of security cooperation between Mexico and the United States.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As our countries continue to deal with the serious challenge of transnational' criminal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
organizations, including drug traffickers, illegal arms traffickers, money launderers, and violent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gangs that threaten people on both sides of the border, we well know there is no quick and easy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
way to stop these criminals and bring them to justice. But nevertheless, during the past now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nearly four years, our countries have collaborated to an extraordinary and unprecedented degree.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We have brought together policy makers and experts from across our governments and societies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
who have worked hand in hand to keep our people safe. And I think the habits of cooperation we,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have built are among our most important achievements, and we will rely on them for a long time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to come.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today, our delegations reviewed the gains we've made on key priorities, including improving,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
law enforcement coordination, reducing the demand for drugs, modernizing our border,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
infrastructure, strengthening the rule of law, and building more resilient and empowered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
communities. We also discussed the lessons we've learned and the work that lies ahead in these,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and other areas. which our joint statement will reflect. I want to underscore how important our,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
security relationship with Mexico is to the United States.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Government of Mexico and the Mexican people have faced the threat posed by these,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
criminals with courage and resolve, and we remain committed to doing everything we can to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
support Mexico as it continues to work to bring those criminals to justice. This is a transnational,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
problem, and it calls for a transnational solution, and the United States believes this is a matter of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
shared responsibility. That was the first message I brought as Secretary of State when I came to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mexico, and it continues to be the hallmark of our efforts together. Making sure our people are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
safe and our neighbors are safe is of the utmost importance to us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now, our two countries share many other priorities, and one of them, empowering women and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
girls, was also addressed today. We took the opportunity, the Foreign Secretary and I, to sign a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Memorandum of Understanding between our countries to work together to advance gender,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
equality, empower girls and women, promote their human rights, and enhance their security.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So again, Secretary Espinosa, let me thank you for years of work and effort, for our productive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
conversations in many places around the world and again today, and for being such a valuable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
colleague and partner. The United States deeply, deeply values our relationship with Mexico and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the ties of family and friendship that connect so many millions of our people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And we look forward to the future. We believe strongly that presidential administrations may,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
change, elections will come and go, but we have established a firm foundation for cooperation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that has already benefited both our countries and which will continue to benefit both of our,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
countries for many years ahead. So thank you very much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MS. NULAND: We'll take (inaudible), Margaret Brennan, CBS News.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
QUESTION: Madam Secretary, thanks for your time. Are you any closer to finding who killed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ambassador Chris Stevens?libya's President says this attack was planned for months. Are you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
confident he's wrong and that security measures were appropriate? And will you leave justice to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the Libyans?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SECRETARY CLINTON: As I said at the outset, we are taking aggressive steps to protect our,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
people and our consulates and embassies around the world. We are reviewing our security,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
posture at every post and working with host govenunents to be sure they know what our security,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
needs are wherever necessary. We are also working closely with the Libyan Government to bring,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the perpetrators to justice so that we can be assured that we have found who murdered our four,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
colleagues and under what circumstances. As I said, the FBI has joined the investigation inside,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Libya, and we will not rest until the people who orchestrated this attack are found and punished.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is also important to look at this strategically and understand what is going on across the region.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In a number of places where protests have turned violent, we are seeing the hand of extremists,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
who are trying to exploit people's inflamed passions for their own agendas. But overwhelmingly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we have found that the people of Egypt, of Libya, of Yemen and Tunisia are not prepared to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
trade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob. They want to turn their attention to the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
future to provide better opportunities for themselves and their children, and they want a strong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
partnership with the United States and the American people based on mutual interests and mutual,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
respect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is part of a larger debate that is going on inside these societies. In Libya, for example, in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
their first free elections, moderates were successful at the polls. But look, there are extremists in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all of these societies and on the outside who are working to take advantage of broad outrage in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
order to incite violence and specifically incite violence against Americans and American,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
facilities.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And as I have said to many of the leaders I have spoken to over the past week, these extremist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
efforts are a threat to the people of the societies and the governments of those societies as well as,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to the region and the United States. And I think it's important at this moment for leaders to put,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
themselves on the right side of this debate â€” to speak out clearly and unequivocally against,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
violence, whoever incites it or conducts it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And in a struggle like this, there can he no doubt where the United States must stand. We support,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those who are fighting for the same values and rights that we believe in â€” in democracy, in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

freedom, in universal rights for men and women, for justice and accountability, And I want to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
underscore that the United States will continue to work with partners and allies in the region and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
around the world to help bring security to these nations so that the promise of the revolutions that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they experienced can be realized.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And finally, on your specific point about Benghazi, we obviously never talk publicly about,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
security at any of our missions for obvious reasons. But that said, let me assure you that our,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
security in Benghazi included a unit of host government security forces, as well as a local guard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
force of the kind that we rely on in many places around the world. In addition to the security,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
outside the compound, we relied on a wall and a robust security presence inside the compound.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And with all of our missions overseas, in advance of September 11th, as is done every year we,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did an evaluation on threat streams. And the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
said we had no actionable intelligence that an attack on our post in Benghazi was planned or,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
imminent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But let me state the obvious again. Our diplomats engage in dangerous work, and it's the nature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of diplomacy in fragile societies and conflict zones to be aware of the necessity for security but,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to also continue the important diplomatic work that has to go on. There is risk inherent in what,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we do and what these brave men and women representing the United States are up against every,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
single day, and we do our very best to limit that risk by ensuring that our security protocols,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reflect the environments in which diplomats work and the threats that they are presented with.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thank you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon. everyone. And it's such a pleasure, as always, to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
welcome the Indonesian Foreign Minister, and I believe the largest delegation that has ever come,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from Indonesia, for the purpose of our third meeting of the U.S.-Indonesia Joint Commission.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This commission is the result of a vision by our two presidents for a comprehensive partnership,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the agreement to that effect was signed in 2010. Thanks to this partnership, the United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and Indonesia are working more closely than ever on a range of issues from global security to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
clean energy and climate to regional trade and commerce.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And today, Marty and I had the chance to take stock of where our teams have come in the time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of the last year, because we had our meeting in Bali a year ago. And I must say, I was very,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
impressed. We covered a great deal today,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But before I start, I'd like to say a few words about the protests in several countries around the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
world. We have condemned in the strongest possible terms the violence that has erupted from,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
these protests. And as I have said, the video that sparked these protests is disgusting and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reprehensible, and the United States Government, of course, had absolutely nothing to do with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But there is no justification for violence, and I want to thank the Foreign Minister and his,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
government for speaking out against violence. We have to look to reasonable people and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
responsible leaders everywhere to stand up to extremists who would seek to take advantage of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this moment to commit violent acts against embassies and their fellow countrymen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today's meetings have highlighted the strong foundation that we have built together. And one of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
our most important concerns is promoting peace and stability in the Asia Pacific. Today, I'm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
announcing that the Obama Administration has informed Congress of the potential sale of eight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AH-64D Apache Longbow helicopters to the Indonesian Government. This agreement will,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
strengthen our comprehensive partnership and help enhance security across the region.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On growth and prosperity, we are increasing our trade relationship that topped $26 billion last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
year. Investments in transportation, energy, and infrastructure are creating jobs and supporting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
economic growth in both countries. For example, the deal between Lion Air and Boeing alone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
represents $21 billion in trade over the next decade. Indonesia's Government has announced half,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a trillion dollars in infrastructure improvements, and we recently signed a memorandum of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
understanding to make it easier for American companies to bid on these projects.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And yesterday, we signed an agreement for implementing our Millennium Challenge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Corporation Compact with Indonesia. Over the next five years, the United States will invest $600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
million in clean energy development, child health and nutrition programs, and efforts to help,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
make Indonesia's Government more transparent and open.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The United States is also looking forward to Indonesia hosting APEC in 2013, and we are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
confident that Indonesia will come to this role with a commitment to promote greater economic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
integration across the Asia Pacific.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Both the Foreign Minister and I believe that strong education is essential to compete in a modem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
global economy. That's why the United States has expanded the Fulbright Program and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
supported partnerships between dozens of American and Indonesian universities. Academic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exchanges between our countries are up and applications from Indonesian students to visit the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
United States have increased by one third. USAID has recently expanded its basic education,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
program to provide $83 million for teacher training and literacy programs for young children.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And we're providing $20 in scholarship funding for Indonesian graduate students.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I also thanked the Minister for Indonesia's leadership in ASEAN. The Foreign Minister's,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
personal leadership has helped lay the groundwork for diplomacy between ASEAN and China as,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it relates to the South China Sea. And we continue to support ASEAN's six-point principles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which we believe will help reduce tensions and pave the way for a comprehensive code of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
conduct for addressing disputes without threats, coercion, or use of force.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Finally, Indonesia and the United States have stood together on a range of global challenges,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from democratic reform in Burma to combating climate change, to working to end the violence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in Syria. We are also coordinating efforts to further develop south-south and triangular,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cooperation, such as enhancing disaster preparedness in Burma and convening a conference on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
women's empowerment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We believe that as the second and third-largest democracies in the world, the United States and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Indonesia have a special responsibility to promote democracy and human rights. And for the last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
four years, Indonesia has hosted the Bali Democracy Forum to promote peaceful, democratic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
transitions through example and open dialogue. Last year, more than 80 countries attended. And,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
once again, the United States will be sending a high-level delegation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So, Minister, thank you for everything. Thank you for the great partnership we've had between,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
us and between our countries.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MS. NULAND: We'll take two questions today,we'll start with Ros Jordan of Al Jazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
English.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
QUESTION: Thank you, Madam Secretary, Mr. Foreign Minister. Madam Secretary, my,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
question is about the ongoing investigation into last week's attack at the consulate in Benghazi.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You are meeting this afternoon with members of Congress to discuss the progress and the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
concerns that they understandably have. First, there is the federal mandate to establish an,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
accountability review board. Have you done so? Who would you like to see chair it? Are there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
certain questions that you desperately want to have answered in order to safeguard the safety of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Foreign Service Officers around the world?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And related to this, given the political instability and the successes of the past year and a half, are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you satisfied that in light of those political changes, enough was done to protect those working in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the Middle East and North Africa? And then finally â€” and this is perhaps going into the area of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rumor and speculation â€” but there is at least one report suggesting that Ambassador Stevens felt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that he was on a, quote," """"al-Qaida hit list."""" Is this a scurrilous rumor? Is this gallows humor",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when one is working in a period of difficulty and great challenge, or is there something more to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what he allegedly â€” and I stress that word â€” said?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, first, let me say I'm looking forward to the opportunity to go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
up to the Congress today. I will be briefing in two separate sessions, the House and the Senate, in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a classified setting, along with my interagency colleagues, as we continue to work together, and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with governments around the world, to ensure that our people and our facilities are safe. I will be,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
joined today by the Director of National Intelligence, General Clapper, by the Deputy Secretary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of Defense, Ash Carter, by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Sandy Witmefeld,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
along with experts from the FBI, the State Department, and elsewhere in the government.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now, I anticipate that this briefing will cover our security posture before and during the events,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the steps we have taken since to do everything we can with host governments to protect our,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
people and our embassies and consulates. The Director of National Intelligence will speak to the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intelligence issues surrounding these events in Libya. Deputy Secretary Carter will brief on the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
superb support we have had from the U.S. military in the wake of these events, and we are at the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very early stages of an FBI investigation. The team from the FBI reached Libya earlier this week.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And I will advise Congress also that I am launching an accountability review board that will be,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chaired by Ambassador Thomas Pickering.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I will also talk about the importance of the broader relationships with these countries in light of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the events of the past days. There are obviously very real challenges in these new democracies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
these fragile societies, but as I said last week, the vast majority of the people in these countries,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did not throw off the tyranny of a dictator to trade it for the tyranny of a mob. And we are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
concerned first and foremost with our own people and facilities, but we are concerned about the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
internal security in these countries because ultimately, that puts at risk the men, women, and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
children of these societies on a daily ongoing basis if actions are not taken to try to restore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
security and civil order.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And let me just conclude by saying that there can be no doubt where the United States stands.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We continue to support those who are fighting for universal values â€” values that we see at work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in Indonesia â€” the third largest democracy in the world. We believe that these values of universal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rights, of justice and accountability, of democracy, are there for every person regardless of where,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that person might live. So I will look forward to having a chance to talk with members of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Congress.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As to your final question, I have absolutely no information or reason to believe that there's any,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
basis for that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
QUESTION: Thank you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MS. NULAND: Last question. Victoria Sidjabat from Tempo Magazine, please.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

designed as a weapon to attack U.S. by raising sentiment anti-U.S. from the countries which has,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Muslim majority population like Indonesia.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Madam Clinton, how do you see this threat as on the long run? If it's continuing happen, it's,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
obviously could give impact to the implementation of (inaudible) program in Indonesia. What is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the reason U.S. Government closed the Embassy and Consulate in Indonesia? What is your,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
expectation from Indonesia Government, for my Minister Marty Natalegawa? How Indonesia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Government respond to the closing of this Embassy and Consulate, it's starting today? Is U.S. -,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Indonesia Government has Capability to protect U.S. Embassy and Consulate. So the (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
program implemented - could be implemented successfidly in Indonesia. Thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, let me begin by saying how grateful we are for the excellent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cooperation we have received from the Government of Indonesia, and in particular, from the law,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enforcement and security institutions in Indonesia. We are very grateful for not only the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cooperation and protection that has been provided to our facilities, but also to the strong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
statements condemning violence from the President, the Foreign Minister, and others.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In consultation with the Government of Indonesia, we have temporarily, for tomorrow, closed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
our facilities. We want to be sure that law enforcement in Indonesia has the ability to do what it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
needs to do to make sure that there is no disruption of civil order and security. So we are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cooperating completely, and we're very grateful for the strong leadership provided by Indonesia.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FOREIGN MINIStER NATALEGAWA: Hello, (inaudible), if I may just also respond.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Precisely as the Secretary had said, the decision by the United States Government to close,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
temporarily its embassies and consulates tomorrow in Indonesia is a decision that's been made,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
based on communication and conversation between the authorities in Indonesia and the United,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
States as well. So in other words, it is an informed decision, a decision that is not intended to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
show any unfriendly intent on the part of anyone, but it is what it is, and it's quite some - it's the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
kind of step that governments actually carry out when situations requires it, even in our case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some of our embassies abroad, when the situation requires us to have a temporary closing of the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
embassy, we do that as well. So it is something that is quite regular and something that is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
actually coordinated as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But if I may just broaden the subject matter, I think as our President had said in the past,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Indonesian Government - the Indonesian people, even, obviously cannot and would not condone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the - any acts of violence against diplomatic premises, against diplomatic personnel, because,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is, truly - would be a challenge to the efficient and a proper conduct of relations among,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
states. So that's our point of departure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At the same time, of course, beyond the immediate issue of protection of the embassies, we have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
still ahead of us the challenge of how to prevent the kind of situations where we are now at in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FOREIGN MINISTER NATALEGAWA: Thank you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Remarks With Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar Before Their Meeting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21-Sep,2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good afternoon, and let me begin by welcoming Foreign Minister Khar on her first visit to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Washington as foreign minister. We've had the opportunity to meet in Islamabad and other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
settings, but I am very pleased that we would have this chance to exchange views on our bilateral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
relationship as well as regional and global issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I want to begin by addressing the events of the day and the past week. Today, we've once again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seen protests in several cities in Pakistan. Unfortunately, some of those protests have turned,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
violent and, sadly, resulted in loss of life. I want to thank the Government of Pakistan for their,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
efforts to protect our Embassy in Islamabad and consulates in Lahore, Peshawar, and Karachi.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And I want to be clear, as I have said on numerous occasions, the violence we have seen cannot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
be tolerated. There is no justification for violence. Of course, there is provocation, and we have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
certainly made clear that we do not in any way support provocation We found the video that's at,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the core of this series of events offensive, disgusting, reprehensible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But that does not provide justification for violence, and therefore it is important for responsible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
leaders, indeed responsible people everywhere, to stand up and speak out against violence and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
particularly against those who would exploit this difficult moment to advance their own,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
extremist ideologies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yesterday afternoon when I briefed the Congress, I made it clear that keeping our people,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everywhere in the world safe is our top priority. What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
attack, and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
murdered four Americans. And we are taking aggressive measures at all of our posts to protect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
our staffs and their families along with locally employed people who provide so many important,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
contributions to the work of our missions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Foreign Minister and I will have a chance to cover a full range of subjects today, and it is no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
secret that the past year and a half has been challenging for Pakistan and the United States. And,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we still have work to do to get our bilateral relationship to the point where we would like it to be,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but â€˜ve 1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-)oth recognize that we can achieve rnol'e \x/hen we work together on a focused agenda. So,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

today is the latest in a series of high-level meetings. Ambassador Marc Grossman has just,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
returned from consultations in Islamabad. I look forward to seeing President Zardari next week,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at the UN General Assembly. At each meeting, we are working to identify the strategic goals we,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
share â€” and there are many â€” and the concrete actions we can each take to accomplish them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our number one shared priority remains pursuing our joint counterterrorism objectives to ensure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the security of American and Pakistani citizens alike. We face a common threat from a common,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enemy, and we must confront terrorism and extremism together. Earlier this Month, I designated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the Haggani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization so we could make full use of every,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
available legal authority to end their deadly attacks. Pakistan's parliament has called for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
expelling foreign fighters so that Pakistan's territory can be fully under control of the Pakistani,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Government and cannot be used to launch attacks against other nations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the follow-through on this is challenging but necessary, and we look forward to working,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with Pakistan as they continue to address these problems. We have both pledged to support a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
secure, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan, which is vital for the security of the region. And I,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
want to thank Foreign Minister Khar for Pakistan's reopening of the NATO supply lines to allow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the movement of goods to Afghanistan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We will discuss the successful first meeting of the Safe Passage Working Group in Islamabad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which brought together Afghan, Pakistani, and U.S. representatives to advance the peace process,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in Afghanistan. The Pakistani Government's public call for insurgents to come forward and talk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with the Afghan Government was particularly important. We are ready to work together to build,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on these steps, and we will continue OUT discussions through bilateral consultations and the U.S.-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Afghanistan-Pakistan Core Group.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now, of course, our relationship goes far beyond our shared security concerns, and today we will,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
discuss the many other ways in which we work together, particularly to create economic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
opportunity for Pakistanis. Foreign Minister Khar and I agree that we need to shift our economic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
relationship front aid to trade and investment. We are working to help Pakistan attract more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
private sector investment We hope to finalize a bilateral investment treaty soon. And we've,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
created a Pakistan private investment initiative to help more of Pakistan's small and medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sized companies get access to capital.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Over the past few years, we have seen Pakistan's civilian government begin to put down stronger,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
roots. And if elections proceed as planned next year, it will mark the first time in Pakistan's,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
history that a civilian-led government has served its full term. The United States supports,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pakistan's economic development, and we have said many times that we want to see democracy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
